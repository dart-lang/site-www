This directory contains the [Dart][], [Jaspr][], and [Jaspr Content][] based
implementation of the [dart.dev documentation website][Dart].

[Dart]: https://dart.dev
[Jaspr]: https://docs.jaspr.site
[Jaspr Content]: https://docs.jaspr.site/content

## Usage

The site should be run with the `./dash_site` tool
from the root of the repository.
Some relevant commands include:

- **Serve:** `./dash_site serve`
- **Build:** `./dash_site build`
- **Clean:** `./dash_site clean`

Run `./dash_site --help` to learn what other commands are available.

## Structure

> [!NOTE]  
> Most of the site content, excluding unprocessed assets,
> is instead located in the root `src/` directory.

The implementation is roughly structured as follows in the `site/` directory:

- `lib/`

  The library root for the Jaspr Content site implementation.

  - `_sass/`

    The [Sass][] style files for the rendered site in the [`.scss` format][].

  - `src/`

    The source code for the site implementation.

    - `archive/`

      The code for building the SDK archive tables for each SDK channel.

    - `components/`

      The custom Jaspr components used across the site,
      both statically and dynamically rendered ones.

    - `extensions/`

      Custom Jaspr Content [page extensions][].

    - `highlight/`

      Syntax highlighting implementation and themes.

    - `layouts/`

      Custom Jaspr Content [page layouts][] for wrapping
      content in shared layouts.

    - `loaders/`

      Custom Jaspr Content [data loaders][] for loading data
      from custom sources or manually adding it to pages.

    - `markdown/`

      Custom `package:markdown` extensions and syntaxes used by the site.

    - `models/`

      Classes to model data for generating pages and rendering components with,
      such as details about a lint rule.

    - `pages/`

      Custom [memory pages][] loaded with code rather than content
      as well as [secondary outputs][], such as `robots.txt`.

    - `util.dart`

      Utility functions used across the site implementation.

  - `main.dart`

    The primary entry point for running and configuring Jaspr and Jaspr Content.

-  `web/`

   Static assets that do not need to be processed by Jaspr Content,
   such as images, PDFs, and JavaScript.

-  `pubspec.yaml`

   The pubspec and dependency configuration for the Jaspr Content site.
