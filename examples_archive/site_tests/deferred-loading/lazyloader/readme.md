This project demonstrates a very simple example of deferred loading.

The breakfast.dart, lunch.dart, and dinner.dart libraries (in /lib)
are loaded lazily, when the user clicks the **Breakfast menu**,
**Lunch menu**, or **Dinner menu** buttons in the browser, respectively.

[Dart Deferred Loading](/docs/spec/deferred-loading.html).
