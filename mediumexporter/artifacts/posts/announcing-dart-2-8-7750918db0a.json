Sir Tony Hoare, who introduced null references in the ALGOL programming language in 1965, famously called them his “billion-dollar mistake” in a QCon talk in 2009. In some cases null values are useful; the challenge is separating those from the cases where they aren’t. For the past year we’ve been busy building support for sound null safety in Dart. This support will extend the type system to express variables that are always non-nullable, but in addition the type system will be fully sound: the Dart compilers and runtimes will be able to trust those types, and be able to produce optimized code when the type system guarantees that a variable isn’t null.","markups":[{"type":10,"start":90,"end":94},{"type":3,"start":241,"end":258,"href":"https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Null-References-The-Billion-Dollar-Mistake-Tony-Hoare/","title":"","rel":"","anchorType":0},{"type":3,"start":421,"end":438,"href":"https://github.com/dart-lang/language/issues/110","title":"","rel":"","anchorType":0},{"type":2,"start":211,"end":235}]},{"name":"0ec3","type":1,"text":"As you can imagine, this is a large undertaking with a lot of moving parts.

We expect the actual impact of these breaking changes — which were pre-announced on the Dart announcement list — to be minimal for regular app code. If you experience any issues with Dart 2.8, we encourage you to review the breaking changes and their descriptions and mitigation steps.
