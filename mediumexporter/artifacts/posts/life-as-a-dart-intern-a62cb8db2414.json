There’s always a fragile balance between being a stubborn software engineer by gritting your teeth and grinding through code that doesn’t make any sense, and reluctantly poking the expert in that code base to help you. The latter almost always saved more time. I preferred allocating a decent amount of time to working independently, taking notes and writing questions as I came across new areas, then prodding another engineer when I had 2 or 3 questions and a solid roadblock. I realized I was much more productive inquiring about problems that would have required 3 hours of troubleshooting alone, compared to 10 minutes of direction and explanation from someone else.","markups":[]},{"name":"9901","type":1,"text":"Safety in a workplace also increases productivity.","markups":[]},{"name":"218a","type":1,"text":"Safety, for me, came in the form of asking questions, making jokes, and having lunch with the team. As soon as the clock flickered to 11:30, I knew that the next half hour would be filled with warm food and bright faces. Every day I would listen to the most elaborate stories and thoughts: the advantages of having 6 fingers, getting a cooked lobster as a Christmas gift, the hours of cleanup after mixing two different pipes in Factorio… anything and everything.

I spent most of the time reading code and understanding new concepts. The Dart compiler is comprised of many large, constantly changing components, which meant I needed to dive into a few different code bases. I loved having the opportunity to reach out to the front-end teams in charge of the static analysis, as well as the back-end teams who managed runtime behaviours. It was amazing to see how the components work together to create a new feature in the Dart language.","markups":[]},{"name":"edb4","type":1,"text":"The rift between implementation and theory was the most challenging aspect of my project. It’s not every day that one would need to solidify a proof into tangible code. While working on variance, this rift surfaced when I had questions — sometimes my inquiries weaved the components of the language proposal with an appropriate implementation. The people I sought for answers either knew which file contained the subtyping algorithm, or knew how the subtyping changes affected assignment operations, but never both. It felt like building a treehouse with a couple pieces of plywood and an artist’s rendition of the end result.","markups":[]},{"name":"aba3","type":1,"text":"Still, working on Dart was immensely rewarding and fun. I loved the challenge, especially knowing that there was so much to learn about areas beyond variance. Dart was, and still is, growing and evolving to better support the developers that use the language.

I listened in as the team looked back on previous mistakes, ensuring that future processes don’t repeat them.","markups":[]},{"name":"3033","type":1,"text":"My internship on the Dart team improved my engineering skills, my communication skills, and my confidence in my own abilities.
