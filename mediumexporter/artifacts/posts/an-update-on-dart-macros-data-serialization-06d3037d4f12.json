As we’ve evolved Dart, we’ve been careful to evaluate language changes against both of these rubrics.","markups":[]},{"name":"c645","type":1,"text":"Powerful metaprogramming — built on rich introspection — has always been a challenge in this context. Runtime introspection (e.g., reflection) makes it difficult to perform the tree-shaking optimizations that allow us to generate smaller binaries. Static introspection (e.g., macros) can take a couple forms. Most languages take a syntactic approach, with limited static reflection on the syntax of programs. We did not believe this was sufficient to achieve our goals. Instead, we aimed to build a macro system which supported deep semantic introspection on the program at compile time. Semantic introspection, unfortunately, turned out to introduce large compile-time costs which made it difficult to keep stateful hot reload hot.","markups":[{"type":2,"start":728,"end":731}]},{"name":"408f","type":1,"text":"We’ve concluded we’re simply too far away from shipping macros with the developer-time performance we require.
