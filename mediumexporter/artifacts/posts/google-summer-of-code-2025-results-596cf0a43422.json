If we provide only the function itself, the model can miss important dependencies inside the function, leading to incomplete or broken tests. To solve this, TestGen uses the Dart analyzer to parse the whole codebase into Declarations, which are classes that represent a code construct like a function, variable, class, or mixin. After parsing, it constructs a dependency graph across these declarations, which shows exactly the pieces of code on which a given declaration depends. This is done by traversing the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of a given declaration and recording its dependencies during the visit.
