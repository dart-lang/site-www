This avoids null dereferencing issues, which Tony Hoare coined a billion-dollar mistake: “This has led to innumerable errors, vulnerabilities, and system crashes, which have probably caused a billion dollars of pain and damage in the last forty years” (Hoare 2009). To resolve this, languages like Swift, C#, and Kotlin support a type system where you can declare variables to either be non-null (can never hold a null value), or nullable (can hold a value or null). This type system can be combined with static analysis to detect any assignment of null to non-nullable variables. The null safety support in the Dart language uses a similar model, making variables non-nullable by default, and only allowing nulls when explicitly declared.","markups":[{"type":3,"start":69,"end":80,"href":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Void_safety","title":"","rel":"","anchorType":0},{"type":3,"start":336,"end":346,"href":"https://web.archive.org/web/20090119110704/http://qconlondon.com/london-2009/presentation/Null+References%3A+The+Billion+Dollar+Mistake","title":"","rel":"","anchorType":0},{"type":2,"start":172,"end":335},{"type":2,"start":336,"end":346},{"type":2,"start":470,"end":478},{"type":2,"start":484,"end":489},{"type":2,"start":513,"end":521}]},{"name":"c41a","type":1,"text":"Taking it one step further, Dart introduces sound null safety in an existing language. A sound system guarantees that a non-nullable variable never contains a null value. During the early planning of Dart null safety, we explored this topic, and the tradeoffs other languages had taken. The Swift design included soundness from the beginning. TypeScript is inherently unsound, as its underlying type system allows for viewing any object as any static type. As you can see in this TypeScript example, we can assign a null value to a non-null variable. For both ergonomic reasons and to avoid migration of all existing code, C# has several exceptions to their null checks. Kotlin has several unsound exceptions, in part due to its goal to interoperate with Java. As you can see in this Kotlin example, generic types can trigger cases where null values can flow into a list declared as holding non-null elements.","markups":[{"type":3,"start":218,"end":229,"href":"https://github.com/dart-lang/language/blob/master/accepted/2.12/nnbd/roadmap.md","title":"","rel":"","anchorType":0},{"type":3,"start":475,"end":498,"href":"https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?#code/MYGwhgzhAECyCeAVeAHApgHkQPmgbwChpoA3MEAVzWgC5pEBuI6YAewDsIAXAJwuC6seACgD6ZStTqIAlPi4ALAJYQAdBKrQAvNHHkqDAL4FjBAGYV2ApR2hgAJvYCC7eIqXsA5hgCi2YWA8PGDwdE5BIb7YADTQaCBoALZo7Fx0PnKExMSBwfCqKBQQCsLxSSlcMkymZDykAIx0CMjoGOwUiQBGaHUAPtDtICC4OuxoAO5wSKhowgAsAExVBLWkC9oNTGycrAmqIKyewgAGAMSNDdAq0AAkeCT16vpohrEk69d370+ShscyBAISjM0GEDx+mgAhKMKENMswAPQI6AAETQoEC1AAHnYYOwOABaQbgToJWKdChcaDjajAMDsaDcJRDXEQJSeBnE6CCK5pZjfDTUGFDJjEVY4ujtLo9DbgwUMYjMbYQXZofaHE6nBaSwlcnEqOh3LF-AGmJHQJzQEAqKmsEH49hE2EgaAASVSahWgWgiXgABkbWEIvA2h1ujwRtAANr1WILWKLAC6TAI5qcjjsA2dqgt7HsmYdTulPBzAAUeB4qYpqDw0BBYVxVAQHM5XO4vMJfQHuLFicsWy43MovBgAPKdABW6K4-i7NtiACJEMoYNd8VS0CQUgWwz0F8tlar1UcF6cAMx0a3cK4QGgL2Jz7jLIA","title":"","rel":"","anchorType":0},{"type":3,"start":638,"end":648,"href":"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/nullable-reference-types-in-csharp/#avoiding-dereferencing-of-nulls","title":"","rel":"","anchorType":0},{"type":3,"start":698,"end":708,"href":"https://kotlinlang.org/docs/null-safety.html#nullable-types-and-non-null-types","title":"","rel":"","anchorType":0},{"type":3,"start":800,"end":813,"href":"https://play.kotlinlang.org/embed?short=yOc5EY5E8&theme=darcula","title":"","rel":"","anchorType":0},{"type":1,"start":28,"end":85},{"type":2,"start":44,"end":61},{"type":2,"start":142,"end":147}]},{"name":"ea69","type":1,"text":"For Dart, we chose the path of sound null safety.
