  **SDK constraints and Dart 2 prereleases:**
  The pub version solver in Dart 2 prereleases can choose package versions that
  haven’t been verified to work with Dart 2.
  If you find a package that has Dart 2 issues,
  please report those issues immediately to the package maintainer,
  and let the Dart community know about any workarounds you find.
  For more information, see the [Dart 2 page](/dart-2).
