  **Dartium is going away in Dart 2.0:**
  In Dart 2.0, you'll use Chrome or other standard browsers for testing
  instead of Dartium, thanks to a new development compiler called
  [_dartdevc_]({{site.webdev}}/tools/dartdevc).
  For information on Dartium's removal, see [Dart 2.0 Updates.](/dart-2.0)
