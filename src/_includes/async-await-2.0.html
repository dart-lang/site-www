**Note for Dart 2:**
There is a slight breaking change for async in Dart 2.
Instead of immediately suspending, async functions execute synchronously
until the first await. In most cases, you won't notice a change in
behavior&mdash;as long as you await each time you call an async method,
it won't be an issue.
