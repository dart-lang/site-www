The tutorial examples, including source for DartPad examples,
live in the "dart-tutorials-samples" repo on GitHub.

DartPad grabs source for these examples from "gist" files.
The gist files are generated from the source in the sample repo,
using the gist-generator.

For info on how to generate the gist files, see:
https://github.com/dart-lang/dart-tutorials-samples/blob/master/README.md

To generate the gist files, you need to use a gist token/password.
Get the token from the creator of the original gist file.
