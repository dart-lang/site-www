  <h4>What's the point?</h4>

  * Command-line applications need to do input and output.
  * The dart:io library provides I/O functionality.
  * The args package helps define and parse command-line arguments.
  * A `Future` object represents a value that will be available at some time in the future.
  * Streams provide a series of asynchronous data events.
  * Most input and output requires the use of streams.
</div>

{{site.alert.note}}
  This tutorial uses the `async` and `await` language features, which rely on the
  [Future]({{_api}}/dart-async/Future-class.html) and
  [Stream]({{_api}}/dart-async/Stream-class.html)
  classes for asynchronous support.
  To learn more about these features, see the
  [asynchronous programming codelab](/codelabs/async-await) and the
  [streams tutorial](/tutorials/language/streams).
{{site.alert.end}}

This tutorial teaches you how to build command-line apps
and shows you a few small command-line applications.
These programs use resources that most command-line applications need,
including the standard output, error, and input streams,
command-line arguments, files and directories, and more.

## Running an app with the standalone Dart VM

To run a command-line app in the Dart VM, use `dart run`.
The `dart` command is part of the [Dart SDK](/tools/sdk).

{{site.alert.important}}
  The location of the SDK installation directory
  (we'll call it _&lt;sdk-install-dir&gt;_) depends on your platform
  and how you installed the SDK.
  You can find `dart` in _&lt;sdk-install-dir&gt;_/bin.
  By putting this directory in your PATH
  you can refer to the `dart` command by name.
{{site.alert.end}}

Let's run a small program.

 1. Create a file called `helloworld.dart` that contains this code:

    <?code-excerpt "misc/test/samples_test.dart (hello-world)"?>
    ```dart
    void main() {
      print('Hello, World!');
    }
    ```

 2. In the directory that contains the file you just created, run the program:

    ```terminal
    $ dart run helloworld.dart
    Hello, World!
    ```

The Dart VM supports many options.
Use `dart --help` to see commonly used options.
Use `dart --verbose` to see all options.

## Overview of the dcat app code

This tutorial covers the details of a small sample app called `dcat`, which
displays the contents of any files listed on the command line. This app uses
various classes, functions, and properties available to command-line apps. For a
brief description of key app features, click the highlighted code below.

{% include_relative _dcat-example.html %}


### Getting dependencies

You might notice that dcat depends on a package named **args**.
To get the args package, use the
[pub package manager](/guides/packages).

A real app has tests, license files, and so on, in a file hierarchy
such as the one in the [Dart command-line app template.][]
But for this first app, let's do the minimum necessary to get the code to run:

[Dart command-line app template.]: https://github.com/dart-lang/stagehand/tree/master/templates/console-full

1. Create a directory named `dcat`, and change to that directory.
2. Inside `dcat`, create a file named `dcat.dart`
   and copy the preceding code into it.
3. Inside `dcat`, create a file named `pubspec.yaml`
   with the following code:

   ```yaml
   name: dcat

   environment:
     sdk: '>=2.6.0 <3.0.0'

   dependencies:
     args: ^1.5.0
   ```
4. Still in the `dcat` directory, run `dart pub get` to get the args package:

   ```terminal
   $ dart pub get
   Resolving dependencies... 
   + args 1.5.2
   Changed 1 dependency!
   ```

{{site.alert.note}}
  To learn more about using packages and organizing your code, see the
  [package documentation](/guides/packages) and
  [layout conventions](/tools/pub/package-layout).
{{site.alert.end}}

### Running dcat

Once you have your app's dependencies,
you can run the app from the command line over any text file,
like `pubspec.yaml` or `quote.txt`
([downloadable file]({{site.repo.this}}/blob/master/examples/misc/test_data/quote.txt?raw=1)):

```terminal
$ dart run dcat.dart -n quote.txt
1 Be yourself. Everyone else is taken. -Oscar Wilde
2 Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened. -Dr. Seuss
3 You only live once, but if you do it right, once is enough. -Mae West
...
```

This command displays each line of the specified file. Because the `-n` argument
is present, a line number is displayed before each line.

## Parsing command-line arguments

The [args package]({{site.pub}}/packages/args) provides
parser support for transforming command-line arguments
into a set of options, flags, and additional values.
Import the package's
[args library]({{argsAPI}}/args-library.html)
as follows:

<?code-excerpt "misc/bin/dcat.dart" retain="package:args"?>
```dart
import 'package:args/args.dart';
```

The `args` library contains these classes, among others:

| Class | Description |
|---|---|
| [ArgParser]({{argsAPI}}/ArgParser-class.html) | A command-line argument parser. |
| [ArgResults]({{argsAPI}}/ArgResults-class.html) | The result of parsing command-line arguments using `ArgParser`. |
{: .table }

Here is the `dcat` code that uses these classes to parse and store command-line
arguments:

<?code-excerpt "misc/bin/dcat.dart (arg processing)" plaster="none" replace="/(ArgR.*|List[^\)]*|\..*|parser.*|argResults\S[^);]+)/[!$&!]/g"?>
{% prettify dart tag=pre+code %}
[!ArgResults argResults;!]

void main([!List<String> arguments!]) {
  exitCode = 0; // presume success
  final [!parser = ArgParser()!]
    [!..addFlag(lineNumber, negatable: false, abbr: 'n');!]


  argResults = [!parser.parse(arguments);!]
  final paths = [!argResults.rest!];

  dcat(paths, [!argResults[lineNumber] as bool!]);
}
{% endprettify %}

The runtime passes command-line arguments to the app's `main()` function as a
list of strings. The `ArgParser` is configured to parse the `-n` flag. The
result of parsing command-line arguments is stored in `argResults`.

The following diagram shows how the `dcat` command line used above
is parsed into an `ArgResults` object.

![Run dcat from the command-line](images/commandlineargs.png){:width="350"}

You can access flags and options by name,
treating an `ArgResults` like a `Map`.
You can access other values using the `rest` property.

The [API reference]({{argsAPI}}/args-library.html)
for the `args` library provides detailed information to help you use
the `ArgParser` and `ArgResults` classes.

## Reading and writing with stdin, stdout, and stderr

Like other languages,
Dart has standard output, standard error, and standard input streams.
The standard I/O streams are defined at the top level of the dart:io library:

| Stream | Description |
|---|---|
| [stdout]({{ioAPI}}/stdout.html) | The standard output |
| [stderr]({{ioAPI}}/stderr.html) | The standard error |
| [stdin]({{ioAPI}}/stdin.html) | The standard input |
{: .table }

Import the dart:io library as follows:

<?code-excerpt "misc/bin/dcat.dart" retain="dart:io"?>
```dart
import 'dart:io';
```

{{site.alert.note}}
  Web apps (apps that depend on dart:html) can't use the dart:io library.
{{site.alert.end}}

### stdout

Here's the code from the `dcat` program that writes the line number to
the `stdout` (if the -n flag is set) followed by the line from the file.

<?code-excerpt "misc/bin/dcat.dart (showLineNumbers)" replace="/stdout\..*/[!$&!]/g"?>
{% prettify dart tag=pre+code %}
if (showLineNumbers) {
  [!stdout.write('${lineNumber++} ');!]
}
[!stdout.writeln(line);!]
{% endprettify %}

The `write()` and `writeln()` methods take an object of any type,
convert it to a string, and print it. The `writeln()` method
also prints a newline character.
`dcat` uses the `write()` method to print the line number so the
line number and the text appear on the same line.

You can also use the `writeAll()` method to print a list of objects,
or use `addStream()` to asynchronously print all of the elements from a stream.

`stdout` provides more functionality than the `print()` function.
For example, you can display the contents of a stream with `stdout`.
However, you must use `print()` instead of `stdout`
for programs that are converted to and run in JavaScript.

### stderr

Use `stderr` to write error messages to the console.
The standard error stream has the same methods as `stdout`,
and you use it in the same way.
Although both `stdout` and `stderr` print to the console,
their output is separate
and can be redirected or piped at the command line
or programmatically to different destinations.

This code from `dcat` prints an error message if the user
tries to list a directory.

<?code-excerpt "misc/bin/dcat.dart (await FileSystemEntity)" replace="/stderr\..*/[!$&!]/g"?>
{% prettify dart tag=pre+code %}
if (await FileSystemEntity.isDirectory(path)) {
  [!stderr.writeln('error: $path is a directory');!]
} else {
  exitCode = 2;
}
{% endprettify %}

### stdin

The standard input stream typically
reads data synchronously from the keyboard,
although it can read asynchronously
and it can get input piped in from the standard
output of another program.

Here's a small program that reads a single line from `stdin`:

<?code-excerpt "misc/bin/dcat1.dart"?>
```dart
import 'dart:io';

void main() {
  stdout.writeln('Type something');
  String input = stdin.readLineSync();
  stdout.writeln('You typed: $input');
}
```

The `readLineSync()` method reads text from the standard input stream,
blocking until the user types in text and presses return.
This little program prints out the typed text.

In the `dcat` program,
if the user does not provide a filename on the command line,
the program instead reads from stdin
using the `pipe()` method.
Because `pipe()` is asynchronous
(returning a future, even though this code doesn't use that return value),
the code that calls it uses `await`.

<?code-excerpt "misc/bin/dcat.dart (pipe)" replace="/pipe/[!$&!]/g"?>
{% prettify dart tag=pre+code %}

await stdin.[!pipe!](stdout);
{% endprettify %}

In this case,
the user types in lines of text and the program copies them to stdout.
The user signals the end of input by pressing `Control`+`D`.

```terminal
$ dart run dcat.dart
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
```

## Getting info about a file

The
[FileSystemEntity]({{ioAPI}}/FileSystemEntity-class.html)
class in the dart:io library provides properties and static methods
that help you inspect and manipulate the file system.

For example, if you have a path,
you can determine whether the path is a file, a directory, a link, or not found
by using the `type()` method from the `FileSystemEntity` class.
Because the `type()` method accesses the file system,
it performs the check asynchronously.

The following code from the `dcat` example uses `FileSystemEntity`
to determine if the path provided on the command line is a directory.
The future returns a boolean that indicates if the path is a directory or not.
Because the check is asynchronous, the code calls `isDirectory()`
using `await`.

<?code-excerpt "misc/bin/dcat.dart (await FileSystemEntity)" replace="/await.*path\)/[!$&!]/g"?>
{% prettify dart tag=pre+code %}
if ([!await FileSystemEntity.isDirectory(path)!]) {
  stderr.writeln('error: $path is a directory');
} else {
  exitCode = 2;
}
{% endprettify %}

Other interesting methods in the `FileSystemEntity` class
include `isFile()`, `exists()`, `stat()`, `delete()`,
and `rename()`, all of which also use a future to return a value.

`FileSystemEntity` is the superclass for the `File`, `Directory`, and `Link` classes.

## Reading a file

`dcat` opens each file listed on the command line
with the `openRead()` method, which returns a stream.
The `await for` block waits for the file to be read
asynchronously. The data prints to stdout when it
becomes available on the stream.

<?code-excerpt "misc/bin/dcat.dart (for path)" remove="/^\s*\/\/!tip.*/" replace="/(    )((await for| *stdout| *if| *}).*)/$1[!$2!]/g"?>
{% prettify dart tag=pre+code %}
for (var path in paths) {
  var lineNumber = 1;
  final lines = utf8.decoder
      .bind(File(path).openRead())
      .transform(const LineSplitter());
  try {
    [!await for (var line in lines) {!]
    [!  if (showLineNumbers) {!]
    [!    stdout.write('${lineNumber++} ');!]
    [!  }!]
    [!  stdout.writeln(line);!]
    [!}!]
  } catch (_) {
    await _handleError(path);
  }
}
{% endprettify %}

The following shows the rest of the code, which uses two decoders that
transform the data before making it available in the `await for` block.
The UTF8 decoder converts the data into Dart strings.
`LineSplitter` splits the data at newlines.

<?code-excerpt "misc/bin/dcat.dart (for path)" remove="/^\s*\/\/!tip.*/" replace="/utf8.decoder|LineSplitter()/[!$&!]/g"?>
{% prettify dart tag=pre+code %}
for (var path in paths) {
  var lineNumber = 1;
  final lines = [!utf8.decoder!]
      .bind(File(path).openRead())
      .transform(const [!LineSplitter!]());
  try {
    await for (var line in lines) {
      if (showLineNumbers) {
        stdout.write('${lineNumber++} ');
      }
      stdout.writeln(line);
    }
  } catch (_) {
    await _handleError(path);
  }
}
{% endprettify %}

The dart:convert library contains these and other data converters,
including one for JSON.
To use these converters you need to import the dart:convert library:

<?code-excerpt "misc/bin/dcat.dart" retain="dart:convert"?>
```dart
import 'dart:convert';
```

## Writing a file

The easiest way to write text to a file is to create a
[File]({{ioAPI}}/File-class.html)
object and use the `writeAsString()` method:

<?code-excerpt "misc/lib/tutorial/cmdline.dart (write quote)"?>
```dart
final quotes = File('quotes.txt');
const stronger = 'That which does not kill us makes us stronger. -Nietzsche';

await quotes.writeAsString(stronger, mode: FileMode.append);
```

The `writeAsString()` method writes the data asynchronously.
It opens the file before writing and closes the file when done.
To append data to an existing file, you can use the optional
parameter `mode` and set its value to `FileMode.append`.
Otherwise, the mode is `FileMode.write` and the previous contents of the file,
if any, are overwritten.

If you want to write more data, you can open the file for writing.
The `openWrite()` method returns an IOSink (the same type as stdin and stderr).
You can continue to write to the file until done,
at which time, you must close the file.
The `close()` method is asynchronous and returns a future.

<?code-excerpt "misc/lib/tutorial/cmdline.dart (write quotes)"?>
```dart
final quotes = File('quotes.txt').openWrite(mode: FileMode.append);

quotes.write("Don't cry because it's over, ");
quotes.writeln("smile because it happened. -Dr. Seuss");
await quotes.close();
```

## Getting environment information

{% assign PlatformAPI = ioAPI | append: '/Platform' -%}

Use the [Platform]({{PlatformAPI}}-class.html) class
to get information about the machine and OS that the program is running on.

[Platform.environment]({{PlatformAPI}}/environment.html)
provides a copy of the environment
variables in an immutable map. If you need a mutable map (modifiable copy) you
can use `Map.from(Platform.environment)`.

<?code-excerpt "misc/lib/tutorial/cmdline.dart (env)"?>
```dart
final envVarMap = Platform.environment;

print('PWD = ${envVarMap["PWD"]}');
print('LOGNAME = ${envVarMap["LOGNAME"]}');
print('PATH = ${envVarMap["PATH"]}');
```

`Platform` provides other useful properties that give
information about the machine, OS, and currently
running program. For example:

- [Platform.isMacOS()]({{PlatformAPI}}/isMacOS.html)
- [Platform.numberOfProcessors]({{PlatformAPI}}/numberOfProcessors.html)
- [Platform.script]({{PlatformAPI}}/script.html)

## Setting exit codes

The dart:io library defines a top-level property,
`exitCode`, that you can change to set the exit code for
the current invocation of the Dart VM.
An exit code is a number passed from
the Dart program to the parent process
to indicate the success, failure, or other state of the
execution of the program.

The `dcat` program sets the exit code
in the `_handleError()` function to indicate that an error
occcurred during execution.

<?code-excerpt "misc/bin/dcat.dart (_handleError)" remove="/^\s*\/\/!tip.*/" replace="/exit.*;/[!$&!]/g"?>
{% prettify dart tag=pre+code %}
Future _handleError(String path) async {
  if (await FileSystemEntity.isDirectory(path)) {
    stderr.writeln('error: $path is a directory');
  } else {
    [!exitCode = 2;!]
  }
}
{% endprettify %}

An exit code of 2 indicates that the program encountered an error.

An alternative to using `exitCode` is to use the top-level `exit()` function,
which sets the exit code and quits the program immediately.
For example, the `_handleError()` function could call `exit(2)`
instead of setting `exitCode` to 2,
but `exit()` would quit the program
and it might not process all of the files on the command line.

{{site.alert.info}}
  Generally speaking, you're better off using the `exitCode` property,
  which sets the exit code but allows the program to continue through to its
  natural completion.
{{site.alert.end}}

Although you can use any number for an exit code,
by convention, the codes in the table below have the following meanings:

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | Success |
| 1 | Warnings |
| 2 | Errors |
{: .table }
