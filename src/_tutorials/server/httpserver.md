Here are some resources for writing servers using Dart:

* Documentation
  * [Using Google Cloud][] has information on Google Cloud products
    that Dart servers can use, such as Cloud Run.
  * [Using Google APIs][] points to resources to help you
    use Firebase and Google client APIs from a Dart app.
* Samples
  * [A simple Dart HTTP server][simple-sample]
    * Uses the [`shelf`][] package.
    * Also uses the [`shelf_router`][] and [`shelf_static`][] packages.
    * Is deployable on Cloud Run.
  * [A Dart HTTP server that uses Cloud Firestore][cloud-sample]
    * Uses the Cloud Firestore features in the [`googleapis`][] package.
    * Also uses the [`googleapis_auth`][], [`shelf`][], and
      [`shelf_router`][] packages.
    * Is deployable on Cloud Run.
