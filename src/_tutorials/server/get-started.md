Follow these steps to start using the Dart SDK to develop command-line and server apps.
First you’ll play with the Dart language and libraries in your browser, no download required.
Then you’ll install the Dart SDK, write a small program, and run that program using the Dart VM.
Finally, you'll use an AOT (_ahead of time_) compiler to compile your finished program to native machine code,
which you'll execute using the Dart runtime.

## 1. Play with Dart code in DartPad

With DartPad you can experiment with the Dart language and APIs,
no download necessary.

For example, here's an embedded DartPad that lets you play with the code for a
small Hello World program. Click **Run** to run the app; the console output
appears beneath the code. Try editing the source code—perhaps you'd like to
change the greeting to use another language. To get the full DartPad experience,

the example at dartpad.dev.</a>

  {% include dartpad-embedded-troubleshooting.md %}

## 2. Install Dart

{% include get-sdk.md %}

## 3. Get more command-line developer tools

Install [`stagehand`,][stagehand] which gives you templates for creating Dart apps:

```terminal
$ pub global activate stagehand
```

Note that although these instructions feature the command line,
many IDEs support Dart development.
Those IDEs use Stagehand behind the scenes when you create new Dart projects.

More information:

* [Dart tools](/tools)
* [Running a script from your path](/tools/pub/cmd/pub-global#running-a-script-from-your-path)

## 4. Create a small app

Create a command-line app:

```terminal
$ mkdir cli
$ cd cli
$ stagehand console-full
```

These commands create a small Dart app that has the following:

* A main Dart source file, `bin/main.dart`, that contains a top-level
  `main()` function. This is the entrypoint for your app.
* An additional Dart file, `lib/cli.dart`, that contains the functionality of
  the app and is imported by the `main.dart` file.
* A pubspec file, `pubspec.yaml`, that contains the app's metadata, including
  information about which [packages](/guides/packages) the app depends on
  and which versions of those packages are required.

## 5. Get the app's dependencies

Use the [`pub`](/tools/pub/cmd) command to get the packages
that the app depends on:

```terminal
$ pub get
```

## 6. Run the app

To run the app from the command line, use the Dart VM by running the
[`dart`](/tools/dart-vm) command:

```terminal
$ dart bin/main.dart
Hello world: 42!
```

If you wish run the app with debugging support, see
[DevTools](/tools/dart-devtools).

## 7. Modify the app

Let's customize the app you just created.

 1. Edit `lib/cli.dart` to calculate a different result. For example, divide the
    previous value by two (for details about `~/`, see [Arithmetic operators][]):

    <?code-excerpt "misc/test/tutorial/get_started.dart (calculate)" replace="/~\/ 2/[!$&!]/g"?>
    {% prettify dart %}
    int calculate() {
      return 6 * 7 [!~/ 2!];
    }
    {% endprettify %}

 1. Save your changes.

 1. Rerun the main entrypoint of your app:

    ```terminal
    $ dart bin/main.dart
    Hello world: 21!
    ```

More information:
[Write command-line apps](/tutorials/server/cmdline)

## 8. Compile for production

The steps above used the Dart VM (`dart`) to run the app. The Dart VM is
optimized for fast, incremental compilation to provide instant feedback
during development. Now that your small app is done,
it's time to AOT compile your Dart code to optimized native machine code.

Use the `dart2native` tool to AOT compile the program to machine code:

```terminal
$ dart2native bin/main.dart -o bin/my_app
```
Notice how the compiled program starts instantly, completing quickly:

```terminal
$ time bin/my_app
Hello world: 21!

user	0m0.008s
sys	0m0.006s
```
