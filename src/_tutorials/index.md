Welcome to the Dart tutorials! 
These teach you how to use the Dart
language, libraries, and tools build applications.

## Language

If you like learning via coding exercises 
checkout the [Dart koans](/codelabs/dart-cheatsheet).
For a more textual introduction see the 
[language intro](/language). 
The Language menu on the left also has tutorials
on more detailed topics, and tutorials written
for those with existing knowledge of other programming languages.

## Libraries

The Libraries menu contains tutorials on the Dart core libraries,
including collections, math, asynchronous programming, and I/O.




## The basics

The following tours assume a basic familiarity with the Dart language,
which you can get from skimming the
[language tour](/language).
Next, learn about futures by following the
[asynchronous programming codelab](/codelabs/async-await).

Once you're familiar with the language and futures,
learn about _streams_ and _packages_,
which are fundamental to most Dart programs.
