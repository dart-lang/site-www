These tutorials teach you how to use the Dart
language, tools, and APIs to build applications.
If you want a hands-on coding experience, try a
**[codelab](/codelabs)**.

## The basics

The following tours assume a basic familiarity with the Dart language,
which you can get from skimming the
[language samples](/samples) or the
[language tour](/guides/language/language-tour).

Once you're familiar with the language,
learn more about _futures_ and _streams_,
which are fundamental to most Dart programs.
Then learn about how to install packages â€”
shared code that can help you be more productive.
