Web pages are programmed in HTML and represented within the browser as a tree structure
called the DOM (Document Object Model). Dart apps can modify the DOM programatically,
thus dynamically changing the web page. First, learn now to connect Dart and HTML.
Then learn how to add, move, and remove DOM elements.

  **Note:**
  These tutorials cover basic, low-level web programming
  with the dart:html library.
  If you use a web framework like [AngularDart,]({{site.angulardart}})
  the concepts in these tutorials might be useful,
  but you might not need to use the dart:html library at all.
  For information about frameworks for Dart web apps,
  see the [web libraries overview](/web/libraries).
