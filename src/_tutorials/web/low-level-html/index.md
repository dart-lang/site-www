Web pages are programmed in HTML and represented within the browser
as a tree structure called the DOM (Document Object Model).
Dart apps can modify the DOM programmatically,
thus dynamically changing the web page.
First, learn now to connect Dart and HTML.
Then learn how to add, move, and remove DOM elements.

{{site.alert.note}}
  These tutorials cover basic, low-level web programming
  with the dart:html library.
  If you use a web framework,
  the concepts in these tutorials might be useful,
  but you might not need to use the dart:html library at all.
  For information about frameworks for Dart web apps,
  see the [web libraries overview](/web/libraries).
