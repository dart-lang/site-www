Web pages are programmed in HTML and represented within the browser as a tree structure
called the DOM (Document Object Model). Dart apps can modify the DOM programatically,
thus dynamically changing the web page. First, learn now to connect Dart and HTML.
Then learn how to add, move, and remove DOM elements.

[TBD: Refer to frameworks like AngularDart that
handle most of this for you.]
