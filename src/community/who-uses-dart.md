## Flutter

The popular [Flutter toolkit][] is powered by the Dart language,
runtimes, tooling, and libraries. Over 500,000 Flutter apps for Android,
iOS, the web, and other targets, are all Dart-based.

The [Flutter showcase][] features popular Flutter apps, including:

* [BMW][]
    > "The BMW Group is establishing itself as a leading automotive app developer
    and provider with a Flutter architecture developed 100% in-house."
* [Sonos][]: 
    > "...If setup is the “grand entryway” to the Sonos ecosystem, Flutter forms
    its elegant façade..."
* [Alibaba][]: 
    > "When the Xianyu team was challenged to improve their user experience by
    developing an app that was consistent across platforms, had beautiful graphics,
    and still loaded fast, they turned to Flutter."
* [PUBG][]: 
    > "When the PUBG MOBILE team wanted to add a community module to allow players
    from all over the world to share gameplay clips and more, they turned to Flutter."

is written completely in Dart.

writing Dart code.

UI of their Smart Displays.
* Both the UI and much of the back-end code for [Google Nest Hub][] and Hub Max
devices are written in Dart.
* The list goes on, with many more Google applications made using Dart and Flutter:
  * [Google Pay][]
  * [Google One][]
  * [Google Fibre][]
  * [Google Elections][]
  * [Google Shopping][]
  * [Cloud Search][]
