The popular [Flutter toolkit][Flutter] relies on the Dart language,
so developers writing Flutter apps—for Android, iOS, or other targets—use Dart.
To find a list of Flutter apps, visit the [Flutter showcase.][showcase]

Google engineers use Dart to create many apps,
including some that are essential to Google's business.
For example, if you use the [Google Ads][] web or mobile app,
you're using a Dart app that supports much of Google's revenue.
Also, the Assistant team at Google uses Dart for features in Smart Displays,
as described in [this announcement.][flutter-io19]
