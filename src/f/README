Welcome to the home for files used by samples!

This is where you can put files that a sample app might read.

Please make sure that any content is copyright free
(such as Jabberwocky by Lewis Carroll).

The dartlang site is set up with CORS headers so that apps,
such as DartPad, can read these files.
Sample apps can only read these files--they can't
write to, or modify, the files in any way.
