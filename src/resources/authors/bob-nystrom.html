{% capture bio %}
    <p>
      Bob Nystrom is an engineer on the Dart team at Google. Out of a perverse idea of "fun",
      he created a series of variously ill- or well-conceived programming languages.
      Before becoming a language nerd, he was a game programmer at EA,
      a user interface designer, and once worked on
      educational videos about how not to set your house on fire because apparently
      children can't figure that out on their own without a giant puppet explaining it
      in poorly rhyming verse.
