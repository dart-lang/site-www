{% capture bio %}
    <p>
      Florian is a software engineer in the Aarhus office,
      where Dart originated.
      He has a passion for dynamic languages
      such as Scheme, JavaScript, and now Dart.
      Before writing his thesis,
      which incidentally was about compiling Scheme to JavaScript,
      he programmed games at Wootsoft.
