This guide introduces DartPad,
a tool for creating effective and engaging educational content for
Dart and Flutter users.
It provides you, the tutorial author,
with advice, tips, and examples for using DartPad.

## What is DartPad? 

[DartPad][] is an online code editor for the Dart language.
In addition to executing regular Dart programs,
it can run Flutter programs and show graphic output.
DartPad enables learners to engage with the content without
having to set up a development environment.
The following screenshot shows DartPad.

## Why use DartPad in a tutorial?

<div class="row">
<div class="col-lg-8 col-md-8 col-sm" markdown="1">

A traditional tutorial provides learners with
step-by-step instructions and static code snippets
aimed at helping the learner to
complete a software development task.

DartPad enables learners to test their knowledge by
running example code and by completing exercises as
they go through the steps in the tutorial.

Coding tutorials are sometimes referred to as _codelabs._

## Design principles for interactive tutorials

DartPad enhances a traditional tutorial through its ability to
support [guided discovery learning,][guided discovery learning]
a recognized learning approach that calls for a balance between
the student’s freedom of exploration and
the teacher’s scaffolding of the learning process.

Past research ([Mayer, Richard E., 2004][]) suggested that
guided discovery learning was more effective than
pure discovery learning in helping students learn and transfer their learning.
Pedagogical principles of coding tutorials
([Kim, Ada S., and Amy J. Ko., 2017][]) also emphasize the importance of
utilization, actionability and feedback, transfer learning, and support.

Based on the guided discovery learning approach and
our application of it on coding tutorial development,
we identified the following principles for
using DartPad in interactive tutorials:

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-3" markdown="1">

{% asset dartpad-best-practices/p_hands-on.png alt="An illustration of hands-on exercise" %}

## Ways of using DartPad in tutorials

The pedagogical principles previously described are realized by
configuring DartPad to show demos, exercises, and quizzes.


<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-3" markdown="1">

**I. Demo**

<div class="col-md-3" markdown="1">

**II. Exercise**

**III. Quiz**

{% asset dartpad-best-practices/m_quiz.png alt="An illustration of a quiz" %}
{: .img-xs-wrapper}

</div>
</div>

### I. Demo

The _demo_ provides interactive code examples for concepts and feature use.
This is similar to how science teachers bring experiments into the classroom to make concepts concrete and memorable.

<div class="col-md-11" markdown="1">

{% asset dartpad-best-practices/demo_screenshot.png alt="A screenshot of a demo" %}
<p style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">
  *A code demo: abstract execution flow and instructions for changing code*
</p>

</div>

### II. Exercise

The _exercise_ provides the necessary scaffolds for the learner to carry out a specific task.
The scaffolds can include a starting template, key information, check points,
and other kinds of feedback and help.

<div class="col-md-11" markdown="1">

{% asset dartpad-best-practices/exercise_screenshot.png alt="A screenshot of an exercise" %}
<p style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">
  *A coding exercise: implementing two async functions*
</p>

</div>

### III. Quiz

The _quiz_ enables the learner to work on another similar problem,
and automatically check if the solution is correct.
This is useful to evaluate whether the [transfer of learning][] happened.

<div class="col-md-11" markdown="1">

{% asset dartpad-best-practices/quiz_future.png alt="A screenshot of a quiz" %}
<p style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">
  *A quiz on async functions, the async and await keywords,
  and errors handling
</p>

</div>



What’s the difference between exercise and quiz?
There are two main differences:

1. **Exercises provide more scaffolds.**
  When you write exercise instructions,
  in addition to describing the expected results
  (for example, add two boxes and ensure that the extra space
  between the two are divided evenly),
  you may step learners through how to get to that outcome
  (for example,  enter two `Text` widgets inside the `Row` and
  use the `manAxisAlignment.SpaceBetween` property).
  Also, there might be more pre-filled code snippets in the starting state,
  and more hints in the exercises than in a quiz.
2. **A quiz is more challenging than an exercise.**
  A quiz tests the transfer of learning.
  The problem in a quiz is usually a bit harder than a problem in an exercise,
  and requires a real understanding of how to complete a task,
  instead of just copying and pasting code snippets.
  Until now, we might not have explicitly claimed "this is a quiz" because
  we didn’t know how users would perceive the word _quiz,_
  and we didn’t want to add too much pressure.

## Case study: the Dart Futures codelab 

So far you've learned about the guiding principles and
ways of using DartPad for creating interactive tutorials.
But how do you apply these principles when you're
developing a real-world tutorial?
We’ll explain that through a detailed case study.
In the case study we used DartPad in the instructional design of
a tutorial titled _[Asynchronous programming: futures, async, await][],_
or _the Dart Futures codelab_ for short.

<div class="col-md-10" markdown="1">

{% asset dartpad-best-practices/futurecodelab2.png alt="A screenshot of the Dart Futures codelab" %}
<p style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">
  *The Dart Futures codelab*
</p>

</div>

This tutorial teaches developers how to write asynchronous code in Dart using
the `Future` class and the `async` and `await` keywords.
The following chart shows the general structure of the codelab and
where DartPad is used to support learning,
including demos, exercises, and a quiz.
In the following topics,
we walk you through how each use case is used in the design of this tutorial.

<div class="col-md-9" markdown="1">

{% asset dartpad-best-practices/ToC.png alt="Table of contents: 5 demos, 2 exercises, and 1 final quiz" %}
<p style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">
  *Table of contents: 5 demos, 2 exercises, and 1 final quiz*
</p>

</div>



### I. Demo 

First, demos were used to accomplish the following goals: 

* Demonstrate how concepts work in action and
  show the use of features in concrete examples.
* Familiarize learners with how to use
  `Future` objects and the `async` and `await` keywords.
* Provide sample code as a reference for hands-on coding exercises.

When you design a demo using DartPad, pay attention to the following things.

#### **Facilitate reflection by explicitly telling learners what to do**

Demos make important points about a concept, but to get those points across,
we need to tell users what they should be looking for in the demo.
Instead of unconsciously jumping into the output,
explicit instructions encourage learners to think about
what they thought would happen and what might not make sense to them.

For example, the following [demo][] presents learners with
an example of incorrectly using an asynchronous function.
Above the code snippet is a prompt:
_Before running this example, try to spot the issue –
what do you think the output will be?_
Beneath the code example is a description of what the code example is about,
how the code is executed,
and an explanation of why the code fails to print the desired value.

<div class="col-md-11" markdown="1">

{% asset dartpad-best-practices/demo_incorrect_usecase.png alt="A prompt to ask the user to consider the output of an example that incorrectly uses an asynchronous function, followed by an explanation." %}
<p style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">
  *A prompt to ask the user to consider the output of an example that
  incorrectly uses an asynchronous function, followed by an explanation.*
</p>

</div>

#### **Encourage learners to play with the code and observe the results**

Interactive demos make hard-to-explain concepts concrete because
they allow learners to actively explore and experiment with the code.
The following example encourages learners to first think about
how execution proceeds within an async function body.
Next, learners are encouraged to reverse line 4 and line 5,
and then observe the difference in the timing of the output.
With this demo,
learners can better understand the execution flow in asynchronous code.

<p style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">
  *A code example:
  abstract execution flow and instructions for changing code*
</p>

</div>

### II. Exercise

After the learner is exposed to the basic concepts and operations of
asynchronous programming in Dart,
the tutorial provides [exercises][] to help them
put this newly acquired knowledge into action.
For example, the following exercise requires learners to
implement two async functions, `reportUserRole()` and `reportLogins(),`
using the `Future` class, the `async` keyword, and the `await` keyword.
Learners have an opportunity to practice what they just learned from the demos.

<div class="col-md-11" markdown="1">
{% asset dartpad-best-practices/exercise_future.png alt="A coding exercise: implementing two async functions" %}
<p style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">
  *A coding exercise: implementing two async functions*
</p>
</div>

When you design a coding exercise,
there are a few things you need to pay attention to.

#### **Describe the exercise workflow**

Learners look for clear direction on what to expect next.
When an exercise is first presented to the learner,
provide a brief description of the exercise’s workflow.
In this case, it’s important to point out that
the goal is to modify the snippet, to make the unit test pass.

For example, the following exercise starts with an introduction:
_The following exercise is a failing unit test that
contains partially completed code snippets.
Your task is to complete the exercise by writing code to make the tests pass._
In addition to explaining what the exercise is about,
the author also clearly communicates that learners don’t need to
implement the hidden code that was provided, such as `main()` and
two asynchronous functions, `getRole()` and `getLoginAmount()`.

<div class="col-md-9" markdown="1">
{% asset dartpad-best-practices/exercise_workflow.png alt="Briefly explain what the exercise is about and what learners are supposed (or not supposed) to do." %}
<p style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">
  *Briefly explain what the exercise is about and
  what learners are supposed (or not supposed) to do.*
</p>
</div>

#### **Visually distinguish between demos and exercises**

When DartPad is embedded in multiple places in a tutorial,
a clear, visual distinction between demos and exercises help
users quickly recognize the expected actions.
When we used the same UIs for both demos and exercises,
one of our study participants said,
“I wasn't sure whether I should just code something or
I'm supposed to just run it to see it.”

In the published Futures codelab,
all embedded DartPads are labeled with clear headings,
such as _Example: Introducing futures_ and
_Exercise: Practice using async and await._
Also, we adopted the light DartPad theme for demos and
the dark DartPad theme for exercises.
The continuous improvement is tracked using [this GitHub issue.][1150]

<div class="col-md-9" markdown="1">
{% asset dartpad-best-practices/instruction_title.png alt="Clearly label the titles, and use different themes for demos and exercises." %}
<p style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">
  *Clearly label the titles,
  and use different themes for demos and exercises.*
</p>
</div>

#### **Steps toward greater confidence**

Interactive tutorials provide hands-on practice so that
learners can accumulate knowledge as they tackle
more and more sophisticated problems.
However, learners can get frustrated if the tutorial
doesn’t prepare them for bigger challenges.
We learned four lessons from developing the Futures codelab.

First, including demos and exercises for each concept before the final quiz
can provide a gradual progression that novices can follow.
An earlier draft of this codelab had a demo for handling errors,
but didn’t have a corresponding exercise to
practice the try-catch concept before the final quiz.
One of our study participants who tried that version said,
“When you have to do something for the first time during the test,
it doesn't feel good.
Because I'm not confident that I'll get this part right.” 

Second, exercises need to provide necessary scaffolds.
When an exercise has multiple tasks,
consider providing more support in the first task.
In the following example, Part 1, `reportUserRole()`,
has more pre-filled code snippets in the starting state,
while in Part 2, `reportLogins()`, only the function name is offered.

<div class="col-md-9" markdown="1">
{% asset dartpad-best-practices/codesnippet_scaffold.png alt="Part 1 has more complete code snippets in the starting state than Part 2 does." %}
<p style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">
  *Part 1 has more complete code snippets in the starting state than
  Part 2 does.*
</p>
</div>

Third, learners appreciate that they can refer to code examples when
working on exercises.
As they get more familiar with the topic and syntax,
they check the code examples less frequently.
In the Futures codelab,
all code examples and exercises are put on the same page.
One of our study participants said,
“I liked how I could be typing here but then also
refer back to the examples to see where I should put stuff.”

Last, demos and exercises (or quizzes) shouldn’t be too similar,
to avoid feeling redundant.
Providing almost identical examples and exercises may confuse learners.
Ultimately, they just copy and paste the code
instead of practicing on their own.
In our initial prototype, the demos and the first exercise used
a similar context and function names, `getUserOrder()` and `reportChange()`.
One of our study participants said,
“This exercise is slightly odd that they’re looking for
basically the exact same code as the example.
I’m not sure what they’re asking me to do.”
We then improved this by changing the context of exercise to
access control instead of ordering coffee.


### III. Quiz 

Before wrapping up, the tutorial provides a final quiz that
covers all the concepts, to help learners apply everything
that they learned in the tutorial to a new setting.
For instance, the following quiz requires learners to
implement three functions, including a non-async function, `addHello()`,
and async functions, `greetUser()` and `sayGoodbye()`.
Learners can practice when to use async functions,
where to use the `Future` class,
how to use the `async` and `await` keywords,
and how to handle errors.

Even though this section is not explicitly labeled as a quiz,
learners may still consider it as a final assessment.
As one of our study participants said,
“Whenever you do like a tutorial and it's the final part,
it's usually to me that means it's like a test of
every single thing that you've written out and combining them.“

<div class="col-md-9" markdown="1">
{% asset dartpad-best-practices/quiz_future.png alt="A coding quiz: implementing 3 functions about async functions, async/await keywords and handling errors" %}
<p style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">
  *A coding quiz: implementing 3 functions about async functions,
  async/await keywords, and handling errors*
</p>
</div>

#### **Minimal amount of help and scaffolds in a quiz**

The problem in a quiz is usually a bit harder than
the problem in an exercise and less guidance is provided.
Compared to the previous “Exercise: Practice using async and await,”
the partially completed code in the starting point for this quiz is minimized.
Also, this quiz has no **Hint** button.


## Final words 

We solicited feedback about the tutorial using
moderated UX studies and an embedded survey.
Learners are satisfied overall with
this interactive tutorial for the following reasons:

* Provides hands-on exercises without
  having to set up a development environment.
* Content is well-explained, straightforward, and easy to read.
* Gives just-in-time and just-enough help and feedback.

DartPad enables us to create effective tutorials that
lower the learning curves, are easy to use, and are more engaging.
If you write tutorials for Dart or Flutter,
we encourage you to consider using DartPad to enhance your tutorial.

“*Exercises are an excellent learning tool!!! Thank you!*”

“*I learn coding concepts the best when I have to
think through the entire process versus just being handed the solution.*”

“*I like the live coding parts are free form.
As long as you get the return correct,
being able to write how you write it is nice.*”
