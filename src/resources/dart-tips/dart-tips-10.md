### Transcript

Hi, my name is Seth Ladd, and welcome to this episode of Dart Tips! We made it
to classes! Class-based object oriented programming is an extremely common and
widely deployed programming model, and Dart has first-class support for classes
and inheritance. Classes is a big topic, so today we start with an intro and
look at fields. Let's get started.

When we say Dart is a class-based object oriented programming language, we mean
it. Everything in Dart is an object, everything is an instance of a class, and
all classes descend from Object. Dart is a single-inheritance language, which
means a class can inherit from, or extend from, only one other class.

A quick primer on classes and objects. A class defines how objects look and how
they behave. A class is like an idea, and to turn the idea into reality you need
an object. An object is like a physical thing, something you can create from a
class, and manipulate on its own. For example, think of a class like "the
blueprint for all sports cars" and an object like "a specific ferarri with
license plate 1234, red paint, and a current speed of 80mph". In this way we say
that an object, a specific thing, is an instance of a class, a conceptual idea.

Classes can be extended to define more specialized classes. A class hierarchy is
a tree-like relationship between high level abstract concepts like Vehicle and
more specific concepts like Car, and then even more specific like Sports Car.

A more specific class inherits from, or extends, a more general class. The top
level of the Dart class hierarchy is Object. That is, all objects are instances
of the class Object.

The Dart SDK ships with classes for everything from strings and numbers to dates
and durations to abstract concepts like Type and Object. But of course, you can
make your own classes! Here's an example:

{% prettify dart %}
class Car {
  String paintColor;
  bool isRunning;

  turnOn() {
    if (checkKey()) {
      isRunning = true;
    } else {
      throw new StateError('key not present');
    }
  }

  turnOff() {
    isRunning = false;
  }

  checkKey() {
    // â€¦
  }
}
{% endprettify %}

This class is named Car. It has two fields: paintColor, and isRunning. Fields
are used to hold the state of an object.

This Car class has three methods: turnOn, turnOff, and checkKey. Methods are
like functions that are bound to an object, and they can access an object's
state. Methods change or expose the state of an object. For example, the
turnOn() method checks first if there is a key present and if so, starts the
car.

To create an object from a class, you need to instantiate it. Here is an
example: Notice the use of new to create a new instance of the Car class. The
object is assigned to the variable named sweetRide. You can now call methods on
the object:

{% prettify dart %}
var sweetRide = new Car();
sweetRide.paintColor = 'red';
sweetRide.turnOn();
print(sweetRide.isRunning); // true
{% endprettify %}

Let's dive into fields, or instance variables. Here is a reminder of the Car
class with its two fields:

{% prettify dart %}
class Car {
  String paintColor;
  bool isRunning;
{% endprettify %}

All instance variables have an implicit getter. This means that even though it
looks like you're accessing a field directly, you're actually going through a
generated getter method. Here is an example. Any non-final instance variable has
an implicit setter. In other words, if the field is not final, it will have a
setter method generated for it.

{% prettify dart %}
print(sweetRide.paintColor);  // calling the paintColor getter
sweetRide.paintColor = 'purple';  // calling the paintColor setter
{% endprettify %}

One of the reasons I love Dart is that it does not promote generating excessive
setters and getters. Of course, you always have the option to make your own
getters and setters. Let's look at how to do this, and why.

Dart wants to make it easier to evolve your API, and help you start simple and
grow over time. A simple way to start is to just use fields. Here is an example:

{% prettify dart %}
class Car {
  bool isEngineRunning;
}

var roadster = new Car();
roadster.isEngineRunning = true;
{% endprettify %}

Let's imagine that over time the class evolves to include a field for the engine.

{% prettify dart %}
class Car {
  bool isEngineRunning;
  Engine engine;
}
{% endprettify %}

We can determine if the engine is running by asking the new engine field. This
makes the isEngineRunning field redundant. However, if we remove
isEngineRunning, we break existing users of the code. We want to change the
implementation of the class without breaking backwards compatibility. This is
exactly why getters and setters were introduced.

Here's how you use them.

{% prettify dart %}
class Car {
  Engine engine;

  bool get isEngineRunning => engine.isRunning;

  void set isEngineRunning(bool isRunning) {
    engine.isRunning = isRunning;
  }
}
{% endprettify %}

Notice how the getter and setter method names are preceded by the words get and
set. A getter has no parameters and returns a value, and the setter has one
parameter and does not return a value.

Here's how you use the new Car class:

{% prettify dart %}
var roadster = new Car();
roadster.isEngineRunning = true;
print(roadster.isEngineRunning); // true
{% endprettify %}

Looks familiar, right? Using setters and getters is transparent to the user of
the class. This allows you to evolve your API over time without breaking
existing users. The Dart way is to start simple, and scale up as you go.

Classes are a big topic, there's much more cool stuff to cover in future
episodes. For example, we'll cover constructors, inheritance, operate
overriding, and much more. Thanks for watching! I'm Seth Ladd, and as we say
here on Dart Tips, stay sharp!
