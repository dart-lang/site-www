    What is the purpose of the `logging` package in Dart?
  options:
    - text: >-
        To provide a way to record events and errors in your application.
      correct: true
      explanation: >-
        The `logging` package provides a flexible system
        for recording events, warnings, errors,
        and other messages during application execution.
    - text: >-
        To handle HTTP requests.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        HTTP requests are handled by `package:http`.
        The `logging` package serves a different purpose.
    - text: >-
        To manage dependencies in your project.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        Dependencies are managed in `pubspec.yaml`.
        The `logging` package is about runtime behavior, not project setup.
    - text: >-
        To create a command-line interface.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        CLI creation uses packages like `args` or custom code.
        The `logging` package helps with a different aspect of applications.
- question: >-
    What does the `hierarchicalLoggingEnabled = true;` line do?
  options:
    - text: >-
        It enables a logger to capture events from child loggers.
      correct: true
      explanation: >-
        With hierarchical logging enabled,
        parent loggers can receive and process events from their child loggers.
    - text: >-
        It enables logging to a hierarchical file system.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        This setting doesn't affect file systems or where logs are stored.
        "Hierarchical" refers to something else entirely.
    - text: >-
        It disables logging to the console.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        Console output is controlled by listeners, not this setting.
        This setting affects how loggers interact with each other.
    - text: >-
        It enables logging of HTTP requests.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        HTTP logging requires specific configuration in your HTTP code.
        This setting affects the logging system's internal structure.
- question: >-
    This lesson uses `logger.severe()`, `logger.warning()`, and `logger.info()`.
    Why use different log levels instead of just `print()`?
  options:
    - text: >-
        You can filter logs by severity,
        showing only warnings and errors in production
        while seeing everything during development.
      correct: true
      explanation: >-
        Log levels let you set a threshold.
        In production, you might only log warnings and above,
        while in development you see info and debug messages too.
    - text: >-
        Different levels use different colors in the console.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        Colors are a presentation choice, not the core reason.
        The real benefit is more fundamental than appearance.
    - text: >-
        Each level writes to a different file automatically.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        File destinations must be configured separately.
        Levels don't automatically determine where logs are stored.
    - text: >-
        Using levels is required by Dart.
        `print()` doesn't work in production.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        `print()` works everywhere in Dart.
        Levels are optional but provide significant advantages
        that `print()` can't offer.
