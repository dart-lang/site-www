- question: >-
    In the `Option` class,
    what is the purpose of the `@override` annotation?
  options:
    - text: >-
        To provide a specific implementation for a method or property
        defined in a parent class.
      correct: true
      explanation: >-
        `@override` indicates that you're providing
        a concrete implementation for an abstract member
        or replacing an inherited implementation.
    - text: >-
        To create a new method that doesn't exist in the parent class.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        `@override` doesn't create new methods.
        New methods are created simply by defining them in the class.
    - text: >-
        To indicate that a method is optional.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        `@override` doesn't affect whether methods are optional.
        Optional parameters use different syntax entirely.
    - text: >-
        To make a property private.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        Privacy is indicated by a leading underscore (`_`), not by annotations.
        `@override` serves a different purpose related to inheritance.
- question: >-
    What is the difference between an `abstract` class
    and a regular class in Dart?
  options:
    - text: >-
        An `abstract` class can't be instantiated directly.
      correct: true
      explanation: >-
        Abstract classes serve as blueprints that other classes extend.
        You can't create instances of an abstract class directly.
    - text: >-
        An `abstract` class can't have any methods.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        Abstract classes can have both abstract methods (without implementation)
        and concrete methods (with implementation).
    - text: >-
        An `abstract` class can only have private methods.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        Abstract classes can have methods with any visibility level.
        The `abstract` keyword doesn't restrict visibility.
    - text: >-
        There is no difference between an `abstract` class and a regular class.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        There is a significant difference.
        Try writing `var x = MyAbstractClass();` and see what happens.
- question: >-
    When should you use an `enum` instead of a class or a set of constants?
  options:
    - text: >-
        When you need a type that can only be one of
        a fixed, known set of values.
      correct: true
      explanation: >-
        Enums are perfect when you have a closed set of options,
        like `flag` versus `option`, days of the week, or status codes.
        The compiler ensures you handle all cases.
    - text: >-
        When you need to store user input that could be any string.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        User input is unpredictable and could be anything.
        Enums work best when you can list every possible value in advance.
    - text: >-
        When you want to create multiple instances with different properties.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        That's what classes are for.
        Each enum value is a singleton,
        there's only one instance for each value.
    - text: >-
        When you need to perform arithmetic operations on the values.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        Use `int` or `double` for arithmetic.
        Enums represent distinct categories, not numeric values
        (though they do have an index).
