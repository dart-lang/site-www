    How do you construct a URL with query parameters using `Uri.https`?
  options:
    - text: >-
        Pass them as a third argument map:
        `Uri.https('api.com', '/search', {'q': 'dart'})`
      correct: true
      explanation: >-
        The third parameter accepts a `Map<String, dynamic>`
        of query parameters. Dart handles URL encoding automatically.
    - text: >-
        Append them to the path string: `Uri.https('api.com', '/search?q=dart')`
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        Query parameters in the path string work but
        aren't the cleanest approach.
    - text: >-
        Use string concatenation: `Uri.https('api.com', '/search') + '?q=dart'`
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        You can't concatenate strings to `Uri` objects using `+`.
        `Uri` provides a different mechanism for adding query parameters.
    - text: >-
        Call `.addQueryParam('q', 'dart')` on the `Uri` object.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        `Uri` objects are immutable and don't have an `addQueryParam` method.
        Query parameters must be specified differently.
- question: >-
    After calling `client.get(url)`,
    how should you check if the request was successful?
  options:
    - text: >-
        Check if `response.statusCode == 200` (or another success code).
      correct: true
      explanation: >-
        HTTP status codes indicate success (200-299)
        or various failures (400s, 500s).
        Always check before processing the response body.
    - text: >-
        Check if `response.body` is not empty.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        An empty body could be valid (like a 204 No Content).
        The body content alone doesn't tell you if the request succeeded.
    - text: >-
        Wrap the call in try/catch as successful requests don't throw.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        HTTP errors (such as 404 and 500) don't throw exceptions by default.
        The request completes normally even when the server returns an error.
    - text: >-
        Check if `response.isSuccess` returns true.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        There's no `isSuccess` property on `Response`.
        You need to examine a different property of the response object.
- question: >-
    The lesson's API functions use a `finally` block to call `client.close()`.
    Why is this important?
  options:
    - text: >-
        To ensure network resources are released even if an exception occurs.
      correct: true
      explanation: >-
        `finally` runs whether the try block succeeds or throws.
        This ensures the client's connections are properly closed,
        preventing resource leaks.
    - text: >-
        To save the response data to disk before the function returns.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        `close()` doesn't save data anywhere.
        Saving data would require explicit file operations.
    - text: >-
        To send a 'connection closed' message to the server.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        While closing affects the connection,
        the main purpose is client-side cleanup,
        not communicating with the server.
    - text: >-
        To clear the response from memory and trigger garbage collection.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        Dart's garbage collector handles memory automatically.
        `close()` releases a different kind of resource.
