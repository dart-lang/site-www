- question: >-
    What keyword is used to mark a function as asynchronous in Dart?
  options:
    - text: >-
        `async`
      correct: true
      explanation: >-
        The `async` keyword marks a function as asynchronous,
        allowing it to use `await` to wait for asynchronous operations.
    - text: >-
        `await`
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        `await` is used inside asynchronous functions to pause for results.
        It doesn't mark a function as asynchronous itself.
    - text: >-
        `future`
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        `Future` is a type that represents a value coming later,
        not a keyword for marking functions.
    - text: >-
        `asynchronous`
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        While descriptive, `asynchronous` isn't a Dart keyword.
        Dart uses a shorter keyword to mark functions as asynchronous.
- question: >-
    What does a `Future<String>` represent in Dart?
  options:
    - text: >-
        A string value that will be available at some point in the future.
      correct: true
      explanation: >-
        A `Future` is like a promise.
        It represents a value that isn't available yet but will be
        once an asynchronous operation (like a network request) finishes.
    - text: >-
        A string that might be `null`.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        Nullable strings have a type of `String?`.
        A `Future<String>` represents a string value that
        will be available later, after an async operation completes.
    - text: >-
        A list of strings that can grow over time.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        A growable list of strings would be `List<String>`.
        `Future<T>` wraps a single value of type `T`, not a collection.
    - text: >-
        A string that is stored in a separate memory location.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        The `Future` type isn't about memory locations or storage.
        Think about what "future" means in everyday language.
- question: >-
    What does `await` do when placed before a `Future`?
  options:
    - text: >-
        It pauses the function until the `Future` completes,
        then returns the unwrapped value.
      correct: true
      explanation: >-
        `await` pauses the execution of the function
        until the `Future` is completed.
    - text: >-
        It cancels the `Future` if it takes too long.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        `await` doesn't cancel anything or set timeouts.
        It simply waits, regardless of how long the operation takes.
    - text: >-
        It runs the `Future` in a separate thread for better performance.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        Dart doesn't automatically use threads this way.
        `await` works within Dart's single-threaded event loop model.
    - text: >-
        It converts the `Future` into a synchronous operation.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        The operation remains asynchronous.
        `await` changes how you write the code, not how it executes.
- question: >-
    While your code is waiting for an HTTP response with `await`,
    what happens to other parts of your application?
  options:
    - text: >-
        Other asynchronous operations and event handlers can continue running.
      correct: true
      explanation: >-
        This is the key benefit of async programming.
        While waiting for one operation, Dart's event loop can handle
        other work, keeping your app responsive.
    - text: >-
        Everything freezes until the response arrives.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        If everything froze, async would provide no benefit.
        Think about why asynchronous programming exists.
    - text: >-
        Dart automatically starts a new thread to handle the waiting.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        Dart uses a single-threaded event loop model.
        `await` works within this model without creating new threads.
    - text: >-
        The program terminates if the response takes too long.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        Programs don't terminate from waiting on async operations.
        There's no built-in timeout that would cause termination.
