- question: >-
    What is the purpose of the `export` statement in a Dart library?
  options:
    - text: >-
        To make declarations from other files available
        through your library's public API.
      correct: true
      explanation: >-
        Export lets you re-expose declarations.
        For example, `export 'src/command.dart';` makes `Command` accessible
        to anyone importing your package.
    - text: >-
        To hide implementation details from other libraries.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        The `export` statement does the opposite of hiding.
        To hide implementation-only members,
        don't include them in any export statement.
    - text: >-
        To import multiple libraries with a single statement.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        `import` and `export` serve different purposes.
        `import` makes code available to your library, while
        `export` does something for consumers of your library.
    - text: >-
        To specify which Dart SDK versions your package supports.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        SDK constraints go in `pubspec.yaml`, not in Dart code.
        `export` is a Dart language feature, not a configuration option.
- question: >-
    How do you add a local package (one on your filesystem) as a dependency?
  options:
    - text: >-
        Use a path dependency like `command_runner: {path: ../command_runner}`.
      correct: true
      explanation: >-
        Path dependencies point to a local directory.
        This is perfect for multi-package projects
        or developing packages before publishing.
    - text: >-
        Use a version constraint like `command_runner: ^1.0.0`.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        Version constraints are for packages published on pub.dev.
        Local packages require a different kind of dependency specification.
    - text: >-
        Copy the package folder into your project's `lib/` directory.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        Copying creates duplication and versioning problems.
        Dart provides a way to reference packages by their location
        without copying them.
    - text: >-
        Run `dart pub add command_runner --local`
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        There's no `--local` flag for `dart pub add`.
        You need to specify the location differently in `pubspec.yaml`
        or by passing a source descriptor to `dart pub add`.
- question: >-
    A package has code in `lib/src/parser.dart`.
    Why might you create `lib/parser.dart`
    that just contains `export 'src/parser.dart';`?
  options:
    - text: >-
        To allow users to import from a clean path
        while keeping implementation files organized in `src/`.
      correct: true
      explanation: >-
        Users can write `import 'package:mylib/parser.dart';`
        instead of reaching into `src/`.
        This separates your public API from internal organization.
    - text: >-
        To make the code run faster by reducing import depth.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        Export doesn't affect runtime performance.
        The number of directories in an import path
        has no impact on how fast code runs.
    - text: >-
        Because Dart requires all public files to be
        in the `lib/` root directory.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        Dart doesn't require this structure.
        It's a convention, not a language requirement.
    - text: >-
        To prevent other packages from importing the `src/` files directly.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        Files in `src/` can technically still be imported directly.
        Dart best practices discourage it, but don't prevent it.
