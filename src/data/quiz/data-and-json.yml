    What is JSON?
  options:
    - text: >-
        A lightweight data-interchange format that's
        easy for humans to read and write and
        easy for machines to parse and generate.
      correct: true
      explanation: >-
        JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a text-based format
        for representing structured data.
        It's widely used for data exchange between
        applications, especially in web APIs.
    - text: >-
        A programming language specifically designed for web development.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        JSON is not a programming language.
        You can't write logic or execute code with JSON.
    - text: >-
        A database format used exclusively by JavaScript applications.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        JSON is not a database format, and it's not exclusive to JavaScript.
        While it originated from JavaScript syntax,
        it's used across many languages and platforms.
    - text: >-
        A Dart-specific library for handling data serialization.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        JSON is not Dart-specific or even a library.
        It existed before Dart and is used everywhere.
- question: >-
    When `jsonDecode` parses a JSON object like `{"name": "Dart"}`,
    what Dart type does it return?
  options:
    - text: >-
        A `Map<String, dynamic>` representing the JSON object.
      correct: true
      explanation: >-
        JSON objects become `Map<String, dynamic>`,
        where keys are strings and values can be any JSON-compatible type.
    - text: >-
        A `String` containing the JSON text.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        `jsonDecode` parses the JSON string into Dart objects.
        It converts the string representation into structured data,
        including maps and lists, not keeping it as a string.
    - text: >-
        A custom `JsonObject` class from `dart:convert`.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        There's no `JsonObject` class in Dart.
        `jsonDecode` returns standard Dart collection types.
    - text: >-
        A `List<String>` containing the key-value pairs.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        A list would lose the key-value relationship.
        JSON objects have named properties, which
        requires a different data structure than a list.
- question: >-
    Why create a `Summary` class with a `fromJson` factory constructor
    instead of just using the raw `Map` from `jsonDecode`?
  options:
    - text: >-
        Type safety, IDE autocompletion, and clearer code
        that documents the expected data structure.
      correct: true
      explanation: >-
        A class gives you compile-time type checking,
        autocomplete for properties, and self-documenting code.
        `summary.title` is clearer than `map['title']`.
    - text: >-
        Raw maps are slower to access than class properties.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        Performance isn't the main reason.
        Map access is quite fast in Dart.
        Think about developer experience instead.
    - text: >-
        `jsonDecode` can't parse nested JSON objects without a class.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        `jsonDecode` handles nested objects fine, they become nested maps.
        Classes serve a different purpose than parsing.
    - text: >-
        Dart requires all JSON data to be converted to classes before use.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        Dart doesn't require this.
        You can use raw maps directly throughout your code.
