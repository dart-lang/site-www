    What is the purpose of the `StringBuffer` class in Dart?
  options:
    - text: >-
        To efficiently build strings by appending multiple parts.
      correct: true
      explanation: >-
        `StringBuffer` provides efficient string concatenation
        by avoiding the creation of intermediate string objects
        during multiple, successive appends.
    - text: >-
        To store a fixed-size string.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        Strings in Dart are immutable and don't have a fixed size concept.
        `StringBuffer` is for a different purpose related to string creation.
    - text: >-
        To encrypt strings.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        Encryption requires specialized cryptography libraries.
        `StringBuffer` is a general-purpose utility, not security-related.
    - text: >-
        To compare two strings for equality.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        String comparison is done using `==` or `compareTo()`.
        `StringBuffer` serves a different purpose.
- question: >-
    What does the `onOutput` argument in the `CommandRunner` class
    allow you to do?
  options:
    - text: >-
        Customize the output handling of a command.
      correct: true
      explanation: >-
        `onOutput` lets you define custom behavior for command output,
        such as formatting, logging, or writing to different destinations.
    - text: >-
        Specify the input for a command.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        Input comes from command-line arguments passed to `run()`.
        The name `onOutput` suggests it's about something else.
    - text: >-
        Set the error message for a command.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        Error handling has its own mechanism (`onError`).
        `onOutput` is for a different kind of result.
    - text: >-
        Define the name of a command.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        Command names are defined in the `Command` class's `name` getter.
        `onOutput` serves a different purpose.
