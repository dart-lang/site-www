    Which command generates a new Dart project
    with the necessary files and directory structure?
  options:
    - text: >-
        `dart create`
      correct: true
      explanation: >-
        `dart create` creates and scaffolds a new project.
        You can also use `-t` to specify a template,
        like `dart create -t console project_name`.
    - text: >-
        `dart new`
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        There is no `dart new` command in Dart.
        Think about what action you want to perform
        when starting a fresh project.
    - text: >-
        `dart init`
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        While some other tools use `init` for this purpose,
        Dart uses a different command.
        Review the lesson to see which command was used.
    - text: >-
        `dart build`
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        `dart build` is used to build existing Dart applications for deployment,
        not for scaffolding new projects.
- question: >-
    Every Dart program starts executing from a specific function.
    What is this function called and why is it important?
  options:
    - text: >-
        The `main` function.
        It's the entry point where program execution begins.
      correct: true
      explanation: >-
        The `main` function is required in executable Dart programs.
        Without it, Dart wouldn't know where to begin running your code.
    - text: >-
        The `start` function.
        It initializes the runtime environment.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        Dart doesn't have a `start` function.
        The Dart runtime is automatically initialized before your code runs.
    - text: >-
        The `run` function.
        It's called by the `dart run` command.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        There's no required `run` function.
        The `dart run` command looks for and
        executes the standard entrypoint function.
    - text: >-
        The `init` function.
        It sets up variables before the program starts.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        Dart doesn't require an `init` function.
        Variables can be defined and intialized in any function.
- question: >-
    In a Dart CLI project,
    where should you place the file containing your `main` function?
  options:
    - text: >-
        In the `bin/` directory,
        because that's the standard location for Dart CLI entry points.
      correct: true
      explanation: >-
        The `bin/` directory contains a program's Dart entry points.
        When you run `dart run`, Dart looks here for your package's entry point.
    - text: >-
        In the `lib/` directory, because that's where all Dart code belongs.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        The `lib/` directory is for library code
        that can be imported by other packages.
    - text: >-
        In the `src/` directory, because that's the standard source folder.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        Dart projects typically use `lib/src/` for implementation details,
        not for executable entry points.
    - text: >-
        In the project root, next to `pubspec.yaml`.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        While technically possible,
        Dart projects have a conventional directory for executables.
        Check where `dart create` placed the entry point file.
