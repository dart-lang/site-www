- question: >-
    What's the relationship between `group`, `test`, and `expect`
    in Dart's testing library?
  options:
    - text: >-
        `group` organizes related tests, `test` defines individual test cases,
        `expect` asserts that values match expectations.
      correct: true
      explanation: >-
        Groups contain tests, tests contain expectations.
        This hierarchy keeps your test suite organized
        and your assertions clear.
    - text: >-
        `group` runs tests, `test` defines assertions,
        `expect` organizes output.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        The roles are mixed up here.
        Think about what each name suggests:
        "group" implies organization, "test" implies a test case.
    - text: >-
        `group` and `test` are interchangeable, and `expect` runs them both.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        They're not interchangeable.
        Each serves a distinct purpose in structuring your test code.
    - text: >-
        `expect` must be called before `test`,
        which must be called before `group`.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        The nesting order is reversed in this answer.
        Think about which element is the container
        and which is contained.
- question: >-
    In `expect(results.length, greaterThan(1))`,
    what is `greaterThan(1)` called and what does it do?
  options:
    - text: >-
        A matcher.
        It describes the condition the actual value should satisfy.
      correct: true
      explanation: >-
        Matchers like `greaterThan`, `equals`, `contains`, and `isNull`
        describe expected conditions.
        They make test assertions readable and provide helpful failure messages.
    - text: >-
        A validator.
        It throws an exception if the value is wrong.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        Close, but not quite.
        Matchers don't throw directly, they instead
        return a result that `expect` uses to pass or fail the test.
    - text: >-
        A comparator.
        It returns `true` or `false` for sorting.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        Comparators are used for sorting collections.
        This serves a different purpose in the testing context.
    - text: >-
        A predicate.
        It filters the results before testing.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        Predicates are typically used for filtering collections.
        In `expect`, the second argument serves
        a different role than filtering.
- question: >-
    You write a test that calls `await File(path).readAsString()`.
    What do you need to add to the test function for this to work?
  options:
    - text: >-
        Mark the test callback as `async`: `test('...', () async { ... })`
      correct: true
      explanation: >-
        Just like regular Dart functions, test callbacks can be `async`.
        The test framework automatically waits
        for the returned `Future` to complete.
    - text: >-
        Wrap the file read in a `Future.sync()` call.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        There's no `Future.sync()` in Dart.
        Think about what you normally do when a function uses `await`.
    - text: >-
        Use `testAsync` instead of `test`.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        There's no `testAsync` function.
        The regular `test` function can handle async operations
        with the right modification to its callback.
    - text: >-
        Call `await Future.delayed(Duration.zero)` first to enable async mode.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        No special initialization or delay is needed.
        The change you need is to the function signature, not its body.
