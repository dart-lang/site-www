    What is an enhanced enum in Dart?
  options:
    - text: >-
        An enum that can have methods and properties.
      correct: true
      explanation: >-
        Enhanced enums allow you to add fields, constructors,
        and methods to enum types,
        making them much more powerful than simple enumerations.
    - text: >-
        An enum that can only have string values.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        Enhanced enums aren't limited to any particular type.
        The "enhanced" part refers to additional capabilities
        beyond basic enumeration.
    - text: >-
        An enum that is automatically generated by the Dart compiler.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        Enums are defined by you, not auto-generated.
        "Enhanced" refers to what you can do within the enum definition.
    - text: >-
        An enum that can only be used in Flutter applications.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        Enhanced enums are a core Dart feature
        available in all Dart applications, not just Flutter.

    What is a Dart extension?
  options:
    - text: >-
        A way to add new methods to existing classes.
      correct: true
      explanation: >-
        Extensions allow you to add new functionality to existing types
        without modifying them or creating subclasses.
    - text: >-
        A way to create new classes from existing classes.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        Creating new classes from existing ones is done
        through inheritance (`extends`) or composition.
        Extensions don't create new types.
    - text: >-
        A way to define new operators in Dart.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        While extensions can define operators,
        that's not their primary or only purpose.
        They're more general than just operators.
    - text: >-
        A way to create new variables in Dart.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        Variables are created with declarations like `var` or `final`.
        Extensions serve a different purpose.
- question: >-
    You want to add a `capitalizeWords()` method to `String`,
    but you can't modify the `String` class. What's the best approach?
  options:
    - text: >-
        Create an extension on `String` that adds the method.
      correct: true
      explanation: >-
        Extensions let you add methods to existing types.
        You can then call `'hello world'.capitalizeWords()`
        as if `capitalizeWords` was built into `String`.
    - text: >-
        Create a `MyString` class that wraps `String` and adds the method.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        Wrapper classes work but require converting between types everywhere.
        There's a cleaner approach that doesn't require wrapping.
    - text: >-
        Create a subclass of `String` with the new method.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        `String` is a core Dart type that can't be subclassed.
        You need a different approach to add methods to it.
    - text: >-
        Create a global function `capitalizeWords(String s)` instead.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        Global functions work but might not read naturally and
        are often hard to discover.
        `capitalizeWords(text)` is less intuitive than `text.capitalizeWords()`.
        Dart offers a way to achieve the latter.
