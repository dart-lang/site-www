- question: >-
    Which keyword is used to declare a constant variable in Dart
    whose value is known at compile time?
  options:
    - text: >-
        `const`
      correct: true
      explanation: >-
        `const` declares a compile-time constant.
        The value must be known at compile time and can never change.
    - text: >-
        `var`
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        Variables declared with `var` can be reassigned
        and aren't required to be known at compile time.
    - text: >-
        `final`
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        `final` creates a variable that can only be initialized once,
        but its value is determined at runtime, not compile time.
    - text: >-
        `static`
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        `static` is used for class-level members, not for declaring constants.
        However, class-level constants, must also be `static`.

    What is the primary purpose of `stdin.readLineSync()` in a CLI application?
  options:
    - text: >-
        To read a single line of text input from the user.
      correct: true
      explanation: >-
        `stdin.readLineSync()` reads a single line of text
        from standard input, allowing your program to receive user input.
    - text: >-
        To print output to the console.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        Printing output is done with `print()`, `stdout.write()`,
        and other similar methods.
    - text: >-
        To execute a command.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        Command execution is done using `Process.run()` or similar methods.
    - text: >-
        To check if a file exists.
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        File existence is checked using `File.existsSync()` or similar methods.

    What does `arguments.sublist(1)` return
    when `arguments` is `['search', 'Dart', 'Programming']`?
  options:
    - text: >-
        `['Dart', 'Programming']`
      correct: true
      explanation: >-
        `sublist(1)` creates a new list containing all elements
        from index 1 onward, skipping the first element.
    - text: >-
        `['search']`
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        `sublist(1)` returns elements starting from
        index 1 (the second element), not just the first element.
    - text: >-
        `['search', 'Dart']`
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        This answer includes `'search'`, but `sublist(1)` starts
        from index 1, which excludes the element at index 0.
    - text: >-
        `['Programming']`
      correct: false
      explanation: >-
        This is only the last element.
        The argument `1` specifies the starting index,
        not how many elements to skip from the end.
