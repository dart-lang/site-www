  subArea: "`dart:io`"
  description: |
    Added support for Unix domain sockets (`AF_UNIX`) on Windows. Support is
    restricted to the subset of features supported by the OS. Windows currently
    does not support the following features for `AF_UNIX` sockets: datagram
    sockets, ancillary data or abstract socket addresses. Unix domain sockets are
    represented in the file-system using _reparse points_ which leads to some
    discrepancies in the behavior of `dart:io` APIs: for example
    `File(socketPath).existsSync()` will return `true` on POSIX operating systems,
    but `false` on Windows. Use `FileSystemEntity.typeSync()` instead to get
    portable behavior.

    Dart 3.10 introduces dot shorthands for enums and other static members,

    supports a new plugin system for custom rules and quick fixes, and several
    new lints and assists have been added. Additionally, the Dart CLI has been
    split from the Dart VM into a separate executable.

    The formatter builds on the previous release's rewrite, incorporating
    feedback, bug fixes, and further enhancements. It now intelligently
    automates trailing comma placement, deciding whether to split constructs
    rather than forcing them. The update also includes style changes to tighten

    The `dart format` command is now tied to the language version as of 3.7. If
    the language version of an input file is 3.7 or later, the code is formatted
    with the new tall style.

    The new style looks similar to the style you get when you add trailing
    commas to argument lists, except that now the formatter will add and remove
    those commas for you. When an argument or parameter lists splits, it is
    formatted like so:

    ```dart
    longFunction(
      longArgument,
      anotherLongArgument,
    );
    ```

  description: |
    Added support for extension types. Extension types are a new feature in Dart
    that allow zero-cost wrapping of an existing type. They are similar to
    wrapper classes and extension methods, but with implementation differences
    and different tradeoffs.

    ```dart
    extension type Meters(int value) {
      String get label => '${value}m';
      Meters operator +(Meters other) => Meters(value + other.value);
    }

    void main() {
      var m = Meters(42); // Has type `Meters`.
      var m2 = m + m; // OK, type `Meters`.
      // int i = m; // Compile-time error, wrong type.
      // m.isEven; // Compile-time error, no such member.
      assert(identical(m, m.value)); // Succeeds.
    }

  description: |
    Expanded type promotion to work on private final fields. Previously only
    available for local variables and parameters, now private final fields can
    promote to non-nullable types through null checks and `is` tests. For
    example, the following code is now sound:

    ```dart
    class Example {
      final int? _privateField;
    
      Example(this._privateField);
    
      void f() {
        if (_privateField != null) {
          // _privateField has now been promoted; you can use it without
          // null checking it.
          int i = _privateField; // OK
        }
      }
    }
    
    // Private field promotions also work from outside of the class:
    void f(Example x) {
      if (x._privateField != null) {
        int i = x._privateField; // OK
      }
    }
    ```

    * Classes with this annotation should also have the `@JS` annotation.
    * Classes with this annotation can not be implemented by classes without
    this annotation.

    Enhanced type inference. This change allows information flow between

    argument's type in some methods, Dart reported errors. These type errors
    cited potential null occurrences. With 2.18, the compiler infers the
    argument type from other values in an invocation. You don't need to specify

    Null safety is now enabled by default in all code that has not opted out.
    When you opt into null safety, types in your code are non-nullable by
    default, meaning that variables can't contain null unless you say they can.
    With null safety, your runtime null-dereference errors turn into edit-time
    analysis errors.

    as the solution for `T`.

    For example, the following code now prints `Null`. Before Dart 2.6, it
    printed `dynamic`. The anonymous closure `() {}` returns the `Null` type.

    ```dart
    import 'dart:async';

    void foo<T>(FutureOr<T> Function() f) { print(T); }

    main() { foo(() {}); }

    Implemented a new sound type system. Before Dart 2.0, types weren't fully
    sound, and Dart relied heavily on runtime type checking. Dart 1.x code had
    to be migrated to Dart 2.

    Many new methods were added to core library classes that will need to be
    implemented if you implement the interfaces of these classes.
