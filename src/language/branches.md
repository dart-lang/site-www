description: Learn how to use branches to control the flow of your Dart code.
---

This page shows how you can control the flow of your Dart code using branches:

- `if` statements and elements
- `if-case` statements and elements
- `switch` statements and expressions

You can also manipulate control flow in Dart using:

- [Loops][], like `for` and `while`
- [Exceptions][], like `try`, `catch`, and `throw`

## If

Dart supports `if` statements with optional `else` clauses. The condition in
parentheses after `if` must be an expression that evaluates to a [boolean][]:

<?code-excerpt "misc/lib/language_tour/control_flow.dart (if-else)"?>
```dart
if (isRaining()) {
  you.bringRainCoat();
} else if (isSnowing()) {
  you.wearJacket();
} else {
  car.putTopDown();
}
```

To learn how to use `if` in an expression context, see [Conditional expressions][]

### If-case

Dart `if` statements support `case` clauses followed by a [pattern][]: 

```dart
if (pair case [int x, int y]) return Point(x, y);
```

If the pattern matches the value,
then the branch executes with any variables the pattern defines in scope.

In the previous example,
the list pattern `[int x, int y]` matches the value `pair`,
so the branch `return Point(x, y)` executes with the variables that
the pattern defined, `x` and `y`.

Otherwise, control flow progresses to the `else` branch to execute, if there is one:

```dart 
if (pair case [int x, int y]) {
  print('Was coordinate array $x,$y');
} else {
  throw FormatException('Invalid coordinates.');
}
```

The if-case statement provides a way to match and
[destructure][] against a _single_ pattern. 
To test a value against _multiple_ patterns, use [switch](#switch).

## Switch statements

A `switch` statement evaluates a value expression against a series of cases.
Each `case` clause is a [pattern][] for the value to match against.
You can use [any kind of pattern][] for a case.

When the value matches a case's pattern, the case body executes. 
Non-empty `case` clauses jump to the end of the switch after completion. They do
not require a `break` statement.
Other valid ways to end a non-empty `case` clause are a [`continue`][break],
[`throw`][], or [`return`][] statement.

Use a `default` or [wildcard `_`][] clause to execute code when no `case` clause matches:

```dart
var command = 'OPEN';
switch (command) {
  case 'CLOSED':
    executeClosed();
  case 'PENDING':
    executePending();
  case 'APPROVED':
    executeApproved();
  case 'DENIED':
    executeDenied();
  case 'OPEN':
    executeOpen();
  default:
    executeUnknown();
}
```

Empty cases fall through to the next case. 
For an empty case that does not fall through,
use [`break`][break] for its body.
For non-sequential fall-through,
you can use a [`continue` statement][break] and a label:

```dart
switch (command) {
  case 'OPEN':
    executeOpen();
    continue newCase;     // Continues executing at the newCase label.
  
  case 'DENIED':          // Empty case falls through.
  case 'CLOSED':
    executeClosed();      // Runs for both DENIED and CLOSED,
  
  newCase:
  case 'PENDING':
    executeNowClosed();   // Runs for both OPEN and PENDING.
}
```

You can use [logical-or patterns][] to allow cases to share a body or a guard.
To learn more about patterns and case clauses, 
check out the patterns documentation on [Switch statements and expressions][].

### Switch expressions

A `switch` _expression_ produces a value based on the expression
body of whichever case matches. 
You can use a switch expression wherever Dart allows expressions,
_except_ at the start of an expression statement. For example:

```dart
var x = switch (y) { ... };

print(switch (x) { ... });

return switch (x) { ... };
```

If you want to use a switch at the start of an expression statement,
use a [switch statement](#switch-statements).

Switch expressions allow you to rewrite a switch _statement_ like this:

```dart
// Where slash, star, comma, semicolon, etc., are constant variables...

switch (charCode) {
  case slash || star || plus || minus:    // Logical-or pattern
    token = operator(charCode);
  case comma || semicolon:                // Logical-or pattern
    token = punctuation(charCode);
  case >= digit0 && <= digit9:            // Relational and logical-and patterns
    token = number();
  default:
    throw invalid();
}
```

Into an _expression_, like this:

```dart
token = switch (charCode) {
  slash || star || plus || minus => operator(charCode),
  comma || semicolon => punctuation(charCode),
  >= digit0 && <= digit9 => number(),
  _ => throw invalid()
};
```

The syntax of a `switch` expression differs from `switch` statement syntax:

- Cases _do not_ start with the `case` keyword.
- A case body is a single expression instead of a series of statements.
- Each case must have a body; there is no implicit fallthrough for empty cases.
- Case patterns are separated from their bodies using `=>` instead of `:`.
- Cases are separated by `,` (and an optional trailing `,` is allowed).
- Default cases can _only_ use `_`, instead of allowing both `default` and `_`.

### Exhaustiveness checking

Exhaustiveness checking is a feature that reports a compile-time
error if it's possible for a value to enter a switch but not match any of the cases.

```dart
bool? b = false;
// Non-exhaustive switch on bool?, missing case to match null possiblity:
switch (b) {
  case true: print('yes');
  case false: print('no');
}
```

A default case (`default` or `_`) covers all possible values that can flow through
a switch. This makes a switch on any type exhaustive.

[Enums][enum] and [sealed types][sealed] are particularly useful for switches
because, even without a default case, their possible values are known and fully
enumerable. Use the [`sealed` modifier][sealed] on a class to enable
exhaustiveness checking when switching over subtypes of that class:

```dart
sealed class Shape {
  double calculateArea();
}

class Square extends Shape { ... }
class Circle extends Shape { ... }

// ...

double calculateArea(Shape shape) =>
  switch (shape) {
    Square(length: var l) => l * l,
    Circle(radius: var r) => math.pi * r * r
  };
```

If anyone were to add a new subclass of `Shape`, this `switch` expression would 
be incomplete. Exhaustiveness checking would inform you of the missing subtype.
This allows you to use Dart in a somewhat 
[functional algebraic datatype style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_data_type).

## Guard clause

To set an optional guard clause after a `case` clause, use the keyword `when`.
A guard clause can follow `if case`, and both `switch` statements and expressions.

```dart
switch (pair) {
  case (int a, int b) when a > b:
    print('First element greater');
  case (int a, int b):
    print('First element not greater');
}
```

Guards evaluate an arbitrary boolean expression _after_ matching.
This allows you to add further constraints on whether a case body should execute.
When the guard clause evaluates to false, execution proceeds to the next case
rather than exiting the entire switch.
