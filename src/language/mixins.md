Mixins are a way of reusing a class's code in multiple class
hierarchies.

To _use_ a mixin, use the `with` keyword followed by one or more mixin
names. The following example shows two classes that use mixins:

<?code-excerpt "misc/lib/language_tour/classes/orchestra.dart (Musician and Maestro)" replace="/(with.*) \{/[!$1!] {/g"?>
{% prettify dart tag=pre+code %}
class Musician extends Performer [!with Musical!] {
  // ···
}

class Maestro extends Person [!with Musical, Aggressive, Demented!] {
  Maestro(String maestroName) {
    name = maestroName;
    canConduct = true;
  }
}
{% endprettify %}

To _implement_ a mixin, create a class that extends Object and
declares no constructors.
Unless you want your mixin to be usable as a regular class,
use the `mixin` keyword instead of `class`.
For example:

<?code-excerpt "misc/lib/language_tour/classes/orchestra.dart (Musical)"?>
```dart
mixin Musical {
  bool canPlayPiano = false;
  bool canCompose = false;
  bool canConduct = false;

  void entertainMe() {
    if (canPlayPiano) {
      print('Playing piano');
    } else if (canConduct) {
      print('Waving hands');
    } else {
      print('Humming to self');
    }
  }
}
```

Sometimes you might want to restrict the types that can use a mixin.
For example, the mixin might depend on being able to invoke a method
that the mixin doesn't define.
As the following example shows, you can restrict a mixin's use
by using the `on` keyword to specify the required superclass:

<?code-excerpt "misc/lib/language_tour/classes/orchestra.dart (mixin-on)" plaster="none" replace="/on Musician2/[!on Musician!]/g" ?>
```dart
class Musician {
  // ...
}
mixin MusicalPerformer [!on Musician!] {
  // ...
}
class SingerDancer extends Musician with MusicalPerformer {
  // ...
}
```

In the preceding code,
only classes that extend or implement the `Musician` class
can use the mixin `MusicalPerformer`.
Because `SingerDancer` extends `Musician`,
`SingerDancer` can mix in `MusicalPerformer`.
