description: Pattern type reference in Dart.

This page is a reference for the different kinds of patterns.
For an overview of how patterns work, where you can use them in Dart, and common
use cases, visit the main [Patterns][] page.

## Cast

`foo as String`

A cast pattern lets you insert a [type cast][] in the middle of destructuring,
before passing the value to another subpattern:

```dart
(num, Object) record = (1, "s");
var (i as int, s as String) = record;
```

Cast patterns will [throw][] if the value doesn't have the stated type.
Like the [null-assert pattern](#null-assert), this lets you forcibly assert the
expected type of some destructured value.

## Constant	

`123, null, 'string', math.pi, SomeClass.constant, const Thing(1, 2), const (1 + 2)`

Constant patterns match when the value is equal to the constant: 

```dart
switch (number) {
  // Matches if 1 == number.
  case 1: // ... 
}
```

You can use simple literals and references to named constants directly as constant patterns:

- Number literals (`123`, `45.56`)
- Boolean literals (`true`)
- String literals (`'string'`)
- Named constants (`someConstant`, `math.pi`, `double.infinity`)
- Constant constructors (`const Point(0, 0)`)
- Constant collection literals (`const []`, `const {1, 2}`)

More complex constant expressions must be parenthesized and prefixed with
`const` (`const (1 + 2)`):

```dart
// List or map pattern:
case [a, b]: // ...

// List or map literal:
case const [a, b]: // ...
```

## Identifier	

`foo, _`

Identifier patterns may behave like a [constant pattern](#constant) or like a
[variable pattern](#variable), depending on the context where they appear:

- [Declaration][] context: declares a new variable with identifier name:
  `var (a, b) = (1, 2);`
- [Assignment][] context: assigns to existing variable with identifier name:
  `(a, b) = (3, 4);`
- [Matching][] context: treated as a named constant pattern (unless its name is `_`):
  ```dart
  const c = 1;
  switch (2) {
    case c: print('match $c');
    default: print('no match'); // Prints "no match".
   }
  ``` 
- [Wildcard](#wildcard) identifier in any context: matches any value and discards it:
  `case [_, var y, _]: print('The middle element is $y');`

## List

`[subpattern1, subpattern2]`

A list pattern matches values that implement [`List`][], and then recursively
matches its subpatterns against the list's elements to destructure them by position:

```dart
switch (obj) {
  // Matches if obj is a list with two elements.
  case [a, b]: // ... 
}
```  

List patterns require that the number of elements in the pattern match the entire
list. You can, however, use a [rest element](#rest-element) as a place holder to
account for any number of elements in a list. 

### Rest element

List patterns can contain _one_ rest element (`...`) which allows matching lists
of arbitrary lengths.

```dart
var [a, b, ..., c, d] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7];
// Prints "1 2 6 7".
print('$a $b $c $d'); 
```

A rest element can also have a subpattern that collects elements that don't match
the other subpatterns in the list, into a new list:

```dart
var [a, b, ...rest, c, d] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7];
// Prints "1 2 [3, 4, 5] 6 7".
print('$a $b $rest $c $d'); 
```

## Logical-and	

`subpattern1 && subpattern2`

A pair of patterns separated by `&&` matches only if both subpatterns match. If the
left branch does not match, the right branch is not evaluated.

Subpatterns in a logical-and pattern can bind variables, but the variables in
each subpattern must not overlap, because they will both be bound if the pattern
matches:

```dart
switch ((1, 2)) {
  // Error, both subpatterns attempt to bind 'b'.
  case (var a, var b) && (var b, var c): // ... 
}
```

## Logical-or

`subpattern1 || subpattern2`

A logical-or pattern separates subpatterns by `||` and matches if any of the
branches match. Branches are evaluated left-to-right. Once a branch matches, the
rest are not evaluated.

```dart
var isPrimary = switch (color) {
  Color.red || Color.yellow || Color.blue => true,
  _ => false
};
```

Subpatterns in a logical-or pattern can bind variables, but the branches must
define the same set of variables, because only one branch will be evaluated when
the pattern matches.

## Map

`{"key": subpattern1, someConst: subpattern2}`

Map patterns match values that implement [`Map`][], and then recursively 
match its subpatterns against the mapâ€™s keys to destructure them.

Map patterns don't require the pattern to match the entire map. A map pattern
ignores any keys that the map contains that aren't matched by the pattern.

## Null-assert	

`subpattern!`

Null-assert patterns match first if the object is not null, then on the value.
They permit non-null values to flow through, but [throw][] if the matched value
is null. 

To ensure `null` values are not silently treated as match failures,
use a null-assert pattern while matching:

```dart
List<String?> row = // ...

switch (row) {
  case ['user', var name!]: // ...
    // 'name' is a non-nullable string here.
}
```

To eliminate `null` values from variable declaration patterns,
use the null-assert pattern:

```dart
(int?, int?) position = // ...

var (x!, y!) = position;
```

To match when the value _is_ null, use the [constant pattern](#constant) `null`.

## Null-check	

`subpattern?`

Null-check patterns match first if the value is not null, and then match the inner
pattern against that same value. They let you bind a variable whose type is the
non-nullable base type of the nullable value being matched.

To treat `null` values as match failures
without throwing, use the null-check pattern.

```dart
String? maybeString = // ... maybeString is nullable with the base type String.
switch (maybeString) {
  case var s?: ...
    // 's' has type non-nullable String here.
}
```

To match when the value _is_ null, use the [constant pattern](#constant) `null`.

## Object

`SomeClass(x: subpattern1, y: subpattern2)`

Object patterns check the matched value against a given named type to destructure
data using getters on the object's properties. They are [refuted][]
if the value doesn't have the same type.

```dart
switch (shape) {
  // Matches if shape is of type Rect, and then against the properties of Rect.
  case Rect(width: var w, height: var h): // ...
}
```  

The getter name can be omitted and inferred from the [variable pattern](#variable)
or [identifier pattern](#identifier) in the field subpattern:

```dart
// Binds new variables x and y to the values of Point's x and y properties.
var Point(:x, :y) = Point(1, 2);
```

Object patterns don't require the pattern to match the entire object.
If an object has extra fields that the pattern doesn't destructure, it can still match.

## Parenthesized

`(subpattern)`

Like parenthesized expressions, parentheses in a pattern let you control pattern
precedence and insert a lower precedence pattern where a higher precedence one is
expected.

## Record

`(subpattern1, subpattern2)`

`(x: subpattern1, y: subpattern2)`

Record patterns match a [record][] object and destructure its fields.
If the value isn't a record with the same [shape][] as the pattern, the match
fails. Otherwise, the field subpatterns are matched against the corresponding
fields in the record.

Record patterns require that the pattern match the entire record. To destructure 
a record with _named_ fields using a pattern, include the field names in the pattern:

```dart
var (myString: foo, myNumber: bar) = (myString: 'string', myNumber: 1);
```

The getter name can be omitted and inferred from the [variable pattern](#variable)
or [identifier pattern](#identifier) in the field subpattern. These pairs of
patterns are each equivalent:

```dart
// Record pattern with variable subpatterns:
var (untyped: untyped, typed: int typed) = // ...
var (:untyped, :int typed) = // ...

switch (obj) {
  case (untyped: var untyped, typed: int typed): // ...
  case (:var untyped, :int typed): // ...
}

// Record pattern wih null-check and null-assert subpatterns:
switch (obj) {
  case (checked: var checked?, asserted: var asserted!): // ...
  case (:var checked?, :var asserted!): // ...
}

// Record pattern wih cast subpattern:
var (field: field as int) = // ...
var (:field as int) = // ...
```

## Relational

`== expression`

`< expression`

Relational patterns compare the matched value to a given constant using any of
the equality or relational operators: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, and `>=`.

The pattern matches when calling the appropriate operator on the matched value
with the constant as an argument returns `true`.

Relational patterns are useful for matching on numeric ranges, especially when
combined with the [logical-and pattern](#logical-and):

```dart
String asciiCharType(int char) {
  const space = 32;
  const zero = 48;
  const nine = 57;

  return switch (char) {
    < space => 'control',
    == space => 'space',
    > space && < zero => 'punctuation',
    >= zero && <= nine => 'digit'
    // Etc...
  }
}
```

## Variable

`var bar, String str, final int _`

Variable patterns bind new variables to values that have been matched or destructured. 
They usually occur as part of a [destructuring pattern][destructure] in order to
capture a destructured value.

The variables are in scope in a region of code that is only reachable when the
pattern has matched.

```dart
switch ((1, 2)) {
  // 'var a' and 'var b' are variable patterns that bind to 1 and 2, respectively.
  case (var a, var b): // ...
  // 'a' and 'b' are in scope in the case body.
}
```

A _typed_ variable pattern only matches if the matched value has the declared type,
and fails otherwise:

```dart
switch ((1, 2)) {
  // Does not match.
  case (int a, String b): // ...
}
```

You can use a [wildcard pattern](#wildcard) as a variable pattern. 

## Wildcard

`_`

A pattern named `_` is a wildcard, either a [variable pattern](#variable) or
[identifier pattern](#identifier), that doesn't bind or assign to any variable.

It's useful as a placeholder in places where you need a subpattern in order to
destructure later positional values:

```dart
var list = [1, 2, 3];
var [_, two, _] = list;
```

A wildcard name with a type annotation is useful when you want to test a value's
type but not bind the value to a name:

```dart
switch (record) {
  case (int _, String _):
    print('First field is int and second is String.');
}
