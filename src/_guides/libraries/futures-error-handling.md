title: Futures and error handling
description: Everything you wanted to know about handling errors and exceptions when writing asynchronous code. And then some.
---

The Dart language has native
[asynchrony support](/guides/language/language-tour#asynchrony-support),
making asynchronous Dart code much easier to read and write.
However, some code—especially older code—might still use
[Future methods][Future class]
such as `then()`, `catchError()`, and `whenComplete()`.

This page can help you avoid some common pitfalls
when using those Future methods.

{{site.alert.warning}}
  You don't need this page if your code uses
  the language's asynchrony support:
  `async`, `await`, and error handling using try-catch.

## The Future API and callbacks

Functions that use the Future API register callbacks that handle
the value (or the error) that completes a Future. For example:

<?code-excerpt "futures/lib/simple.dart (then-catch)"?>
```dart
myFunc().then(processValue).catchError(handleError);
```

The registered callbacks fire based on the following rules: `then()`'s
callback fires if it is invoked on a Future that completes with a value;
`catchError()`'s callback fires if it is invoked on a Future that completes
with an error.

In the example above, if `myFunc()`'s Future completes with a value,
`then()`'s callback fires. If no new error is produced within `then()`,
`catchError()`'s callback does not fire. On the other hand, if `myFunc()`
completes with an error, `then()`'s callback does not fire, and
`catchError()`'s callback does.

## Examples of using then() with catchError()

Chained `then()` and `catchError()` invocations are a common pattern when
dealing with Futures, and can be thought of as the rough equivalent of
try-catch blocks.

The next few sections give examples of this pattern.

### catchError() as a comprehensive error handler

The following example deals with throwing an exception from within `then()`'s
callback and demonstrates `catchError()`'s versatility as an error handler:

<?code-excerpt "futures/lib/simple.dart (comprehensive-errors)" replace="/ellipsis\(\);/.../g;"?>
```dart
myFunc().then((value) {
  doSomethingWith(value);
  ...
  throw Exception('Some arbitrary error');
}).catchError(handleError);
```

If `myFunc()`'s Future completes with a value, `then()`'s callback fires. If
code within `then()`'s callback throws (as it does in the example above),
`then()`'s Future completes with an error. That error is handled by
`catchError()`.

If `myFunc()`'s Future completes with an error, `then()`'s Future completes
with that error. The error is also handled by `catchError()`.

Regardless of whether the error originated within `myFunc()` or within
`then()`, `catchError()` successfully handles it.

### Error handling within then()

For more granular error handling, you can register a second (`onError`)
callback within `then()` to handle Futures completed with errors. Here is
`then()`'s signature:

<?code-excerpt "futures/lib/simple.dart (future-then)"?>
```dart
Future<R> then<R>(FutureOr<R> Function(T value) onValue, {Function? onError});
```

Register the optional onError callback only if you want to differentiate
between an error forwarded _to_ `then()`, and an error generated _within_
`then()`:

<?code-excerpt "futures/lib/simple.dart (throws-then-catch)"?>
```dart
funcThatThrows().then(successCallback, onError: (e) {
  handleError(e); // Original error.
  anotherFuncThatThrows(); // Oops, new error.
}).catchError(handleError); // Error from within then() handled.
```

In the example above, `funcThatThrows()`'s Future's error is handled with the
`onError` callback; `anotherFuncThatThrows()` causes `then()`'s Future to
complete with an error; this error is handled by `catchError()`.

In general, implementing two different error handling strategies is not
recommended: register a second callback only if there is a compelling reason
to catch the error within `then()`.

### Errors in the middle of a long chain

It is common to have a succession of `then()` calls, and catch errors
generated from any part of the chain using `catchError()`:

<?code-excerpt "futures/lib/long_chain.dart"?>
```dart
Future<String> one() => Future.value('from one');
Future<String> two() => Future.error('error from two');
Future<String> three() => Future.value('from three');
Future<String> four() => Future.value('from four');

void main() {
  one() // Future completes with "from one".
      .then((_) => two()) // Future completes with two()'s error.
      .then((_) => three()) // Future completes with two()'s error.
      .then((_) => four()) // Future completes with two()'s error.
      .then((value) => value.length) // Future completes with two()'s error.
      .catchError((e) {
    print('Got error: $e'); // Finally, callback fires.
    return 42; // Future completes with 42.
  }).then((value) {
    print('The value is $value');
  });
}

// Output of this program:
//   Got error: error from two
//   The value is 42
```

In the code above, `one()`'s Future completes with a value, but `two()`'s
Future completes with an error. When `then()` is invoked on a Future that
completes with an error, `then()`'s callback does not fire. Instead,
`then()`'s Future completes with the error of its receiver. In our example,
this means that after `two()` is called, the Future returned by every
subsequent `then()`completes with `two()`'s error. That error is finally
handled within `catchError()`.

### Handling specific errors

What if we want to catch a specific error? Or catch more than one error?

`catchError()` takes an optional named argument, `test`, that
allows us to query the kind of error thrown.

<?code-excerpt "futures/lib/simple.dart (future-catch-error)"?>
```dart
Future<T> catchError(Function onError, {bool Function(Object error)? test});
```

Consider `handleAuthResponse(params)`, a function that authenticates a user
based on the params provided, and redirects the user to an appropriate URL.
Given the complex workflow, `handleAuthResponse()` could generate various
errors and exceptions, and you should handle them differently. Here's
how you can use `test` to do that:

<?code-excerpt "futures/lib/simple.dart (auth-response)" replace="/ellipsis\(\)/.../g;"?>
```dart
void main() {
  handleAuthResponse(const {'username': 'dash', 'age': 3})
      .then((_) => ...)
      .catchError(handleFormatException, test: (e) => e is FormatException)
      .catchError(handleAuthorizationException,
          test: (e) => e is AuthorizationException);
}
```

## Async try-catch-finally using whenComplete()

If `then().catchError()` mirrors a try-catch, `whenComplete()` is the
equivalent of 'finally'. The callback registered within `whenComplete()` is
called when `whenComplete()`'s receiver completes, whether it does so with a
value or with an error:

<?code-excerpt "futures/lib/simple.dart (connect-server)"?>
```dart
final server = connectToServer();
server
    .post(myUrl, fields: const {'name': 'Dash', 'profession': 'mascot'})
    .then(handleResponse)
    .catchError(handleError)
    .whenComplete(server.close);
```

We want to call `server.close` regardless of whether `server.post()` produces
a valid response, or an error. We ensure this happens by placing it inside
`whenComplete()`.

### Completing the Future returned by whenComplete()

If no error is emitted from within `whenComplete()`, its Future completes
the same way as the Future that `whenComplete()` is invoked on. This is
easiest to understand through examples.

In the code below, `then()`'s Future completes with an error, so
`whenComplete()`'s Future also completes with that error.

<?code-excerpt "futures/lib/when_complete.dart (with-error)" replace="/withErrorMain/main/g; "?>
```dart
void main() {
  funcThatThrows()
      // Future completes with an error:
      .then((_) => print("Won't reach here"))
      // Future completes with the same error:
      .whenComplete(() => print('Reaches here'))
      // Future completes with the same error:
      .then((_) => print("Won't reach here"))
      // Error is handled here:
      .catchError(handleError);
}
```

In the code below, `then()`'s Future completes with an error, which is now
handled by `catchError()`.  Because `catchError()`'s Future completes with
`someObject`, `whenComplete()`'s Future completes with that same object.

<?code-excerpt "futures/lib/when_complete.dart (with-object)" replace="/ellipsis\(\)/.../g; /withObjectMain/main/g; "?>
```dart
void main() {
  funcThatThrows()
      // Future completes with an error:
      .then((_) => ...)
      .catchError((e) {
    handleError(e);
    printErrorMessage();
    return someObject; // Future completes with someObject
  }).whenComplete(() => print('Done!')); // Future completes with someObject
}
```

### Errors originating within whenComplete()

If `whenComplete()`'s callback throws an error, then `whenComplete()`'s Future
completes with that error:

<?code-excerpt "futures/lib/when_complete.dart (when-complete-error)" replace="/whenCompleteError/main/g; "?>
```dart
void main() {
  funcThatThrows()
      // Future completes with a value:
      .catchError(handleError)
      // Future completes with an error:
      .whenComplete(() => throw Exception('New error'))
      // Error is handled:
      .catchError(handleError);
}
```


## Potential problem: failing to register error handlers early

It is crucial that error handlers are installed before a Future completes:
this avoids scenarios where a Future completes with an error, the error
handler is not yet attached, and the error accidentally propagates. Consider
this code:

<?code-excerpt "futures/lib/early_error_handlers.dart (bad)" replace="/ellipsis\(\)/.../g; /mainBad/main/g;"?>
```dart
void main() {
  Future<Object> future = funcThatThrows();

  // BAD: Too late to handle funcThatThrows() exception.
  Future.delayed(const Duration(milliseconds: 500), () {
    future.then(...).catchError(...);
  });
}
```

In the code above, `catchError()` is not registered until half a second after
`funcThatThrows()` is called, and the error goes unhandled.

The problem goes away if `funcThatThrows()` is called within the
`Future.delayed()` callback:

<?code-excerpt "futures/lib/early_error_handlers.dart (good)" replace="/ellipsis\(\)/.../g; /mainGood/main/g;"?>
```dart
void main() {
  Future.delayed(const Duration(milliseconds: 500), () {
    funcThatThrows().then(...).catchError(...); // We get here.
  });
}
```

## Potential problem: accidentally mixing synchronous and asynchronous errors

Functions that return Futures should almost always emit their errors in the
future. Since we do not want the caller of such functions to have to
implement multiple error-handling scenarios, we want to prevent any synchronous
errors from leaking out. Consider this code:

<?code-excerpt "futures/bin/mixing_errors_problematic.dart (parse)"?>
```dart
Future<int> parseAndRead(Map<String, dynamic> data) {
  final filename = obtainFilename(data); // Could throw.
  final file = File(filename);
  return file.readAsString().then((contents) {
    return parseFileData(contents); // Could throw.
  });
}
```

Two functions in that code could potentially throw synchronously:
`obtainFilename()` and `parseFileData()`. Because `parseFileData()` executes
inside a `then()` callback, its error does not leak out of the function.
Instead, `then()`'s Future completes with `parseFileData()`'s error, the error
eventually completes `parseAndRead()`'s Future, and the error can be
successfully handled by `catchError()`.

But `obtainFilename()` is not called within a `then()` callback; if _it_
throws, a synchronous error propagates:

<?code-excerpt "futures/bin/mixing_errors_problematic.dart (main)"?>
```dart
void main() {
  parseAndRead(data).catchError((e) {
    print('Inside catchError');
    print(e);
  });
}

// Program Output:
//   Unhandled exception:
//   <error from obtainFilename>
//   ...
```

Because using `catchError()` does not capture the error, a client of
`parseAndRead()` would implement a separate error-handling strategy for this
error.

### Solution: Using Future.sync() to wrap your code

A common pattern for ensuring that no synchronous error is accidentally
thrown from a function is to wrap the function body inside a new `Future.sync()`
callback:

<?code-excerpt "futures/bin/mixing_errors_solution.dart (parse)"?>
```dart
Future<int> parseAndRead(Map<String, dynamic> data) {
  return Future.sync(() {
    final filename = obtainFilename(data); // Could throw.
    final file = File(filename);
    return file.readAsString().then((contents) {
      return parseFileData(contents); // Could throw.
    });
  });
}
```

If the callback returns a non-Future value, `Future.sync()`'s Future completes
with that value. If the callback throws (as it does in the example
above), the Future completes with an error. If the callback itself returns a
Future, the value or the error of that Future completes `Future.sync()`'s
Future.

With code wrapped within `Future.sync()`, `catchError()` can handle all errors:

<?code-excerpt "futures/bin/mixing_errors_solution.dart (main)"?>
```dart
void main() {
  parseAndRead(data).catchError((e) {
    print('Inside catchError');
    print(e);
  });
}

// Program Output:
//   Inside catchError
//   <error from obtainFilename>
```

`Future.sync()` makes your code resilient against uncaught exceptions. If your
function has a lot of code packed into it, chances are that you could be doing
something dangerous without realizing it:

<?code-excerpt "futures/bin/mixing_errors_problematic.dart (fragile)" replace="/ellipsis\(\);/.../g;"?>
```dart
Future fragileFunc() {
  return Future.sync(() {
    final x = someFunc(); // Unexpectedly throws in some rare cases.
    var y = 10 / x; // x should not equal 0.
    ...
  });
}
```

`Future.sync()` not only allows you to handle errors you know might occur, but
also prevents errors from *accidentally* leaking out of your function.
