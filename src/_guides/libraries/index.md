Dart programs rely on _libraries_.
Several common libraries are provided for you.
For example, `dart:core` provides a small but critical set of built-in functionality,
such as numbers, collections, and strings. Another essential library is
`dart:async`, which supports asynchronous programming with classes
like Future and Stream.
You can get additional libraries by importing them from _packages_.
