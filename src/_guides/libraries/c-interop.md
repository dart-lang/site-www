samples: "https://github.com/dart-lang/samples/tree/master/ffi"
---

Dart mobile, command-line, and server apps 
running on the [Dart Native platform](/overview#platform) 
can use the `dart:ffi` library to call native C APIs,
and to read, write, allocate, and deallocate native memory.
_FFI_ stands for [_foreign function interface._][FFI]
Other terms for similar functionality include
_native interface_ and _language bindings._

API documentation is available in the
[`dart:ffi` API reference.]({{site.dart-api}}/dart-ffi/dart-ffi-library.html)

## Examples

The following examples show how to use the `dart:ffi` library:

## Walkthrough of hello_world

The [hello_world example][hello_world] has the minimum necessary code
for calling a C library.

### Files

The hello_world example has the following files:

| **Source file**                                                          | **Description**                                                                                  |

[PENDING: say something about other files, like setup.sh?]
[TODO (https://github.com/dart-lang/site-www/issues/2219): Fix build instructions.]
{% endcomment %}

Building the C library creates several files,
including a dynamic library file named
`libhello.dylib` (macOS), 
`libhello.dll` (Windows), or
`libhello.so` (Linux).


### Building and running

Here's an example of building the dynamic library and executing the Dart app:

```terminal
$ cd hello_library
$ cmake .
...
$ make
...
$ cd ..
$ dart pub get
$ dart run hello.dart
Hello World
```

{{site.alert.info}}
  **On macOS,** executables, including the Dart VM (`dart`),
  can load only **signed libraries.**
  For more information on signing libraries, 
  see Apple's [Code Signing Guide.][codesign]

### Using dart:ffi

The [`hello.dart` file]({{page.hw}}/hello.dart)
illustrates the steps for using `dart:ffi` to call a C function:

1. Import `dart:ffi`.
2. Import the path library that you'll use to store the path of dynamic library.
3. Create a typedef with the FFI type signature of the C function.
4. Create a typedef for the variable that you'll use when calling the C function.
5. Create a variable to store the path of the dynamic library.
6. Open the dynamic library that contains the C function.
7. Get a reference to the C function, and put it into a variable.
8. Call the C function.

Here's the code for each step.

1. Import `dart:ffi`.
```dart
import 'dart:ffi' as ffi;
```

2. Import the path library that you'll use to store the path of dynamic library.
```dart
import 'dart:io' show Platform, Directory;
import 'package:path/path.dart' as path;
```

3. Create a typedef with the FFI type signature of the C function. <br>
   See [Interfacing with native types](#interfacing-with-native-types)
   for commonly used types defined by `dart:ffi` library.
```dart
typedef hello_world_func = ffi.Void Function();
```

4. Create a typedef for the variable that you'll use
   when calling the C function.
```dart
typedef HelloWorld = void Function();
```

5. Create a variable to store the path of the dynamic library.
```dart
var libraryPath = path.join(Directory.current.path, 'hello_library',
    'libhello.so');
if (Platform.isMacOS) { 
  libraryPath = path.join(Directory.current.path, 'hello_library', 
      'libhello.dylib');
} else if (Platform.isWindows) { 
  libraryPath = path.join(Directory.current.path, 'hello_library', 
      'Debug', 'hello.dll');
} 
```

6. Open the dynamic library that contains the C function.
```dart
  final dylib = ffi.DynamicLibrary.open(libraryPath);
```

7. Get a reference to the C function, 
   and put it into a variable.
   This code uses the typedefs defined in steps 2 and 3, 
   along with the dynamic library variable from step 4.
```dart
  final HelloWorld hello = dylib
      .lookup<ffi.NativeFunction<hello_world_func>>('hello_world')
      .asFunction();
```

8. Call the C function.
```dart
  hello();
```

Once you understand the hello_world example, 
you should be ready to look at the
[other `dart:ffi` examples](#examples).


## Bundling and loading C libraries

How you bundle (or _package_ or _distribute_)
a C library with your package or app
and then load that library
depends on your platform and the type of library.
For details, see the following:

* [Flutter `dart:ffi` page][binding]
* [`dart:ffi` examples]({{page.samples}})

## Interfacing with native types

The `dart:ffi` library provides multiple types
that implement [`NativeType`][]
and represent native types in C.

Some native types are only used as markers in type signatures
while others (or their subtypes) can be instantiated.

#### Instantiable native types

The following native types can be used as markers in type signatures
and they (or their subtypes) can be instantiated in Dart code:

| **Dart type**                                                                               | **Description**                                                  |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Array]({{site.dart-api}}/{{site.data.pkg-vers.SDK.channel}}/dart-ffi/Array-class.html)     | A fixed-sized array of items. Supertype of type specific arrays. |
| [Pointer]({{site.dart-api}}/{{site.data.pkg-vers.SDK.channel}}/dart-ffi/Pointer-class.html) | Represents a pointer into native C memory.                       |
| [Struct]({{site.dart-api}}/{{site.data.pkg-vers.SDK.channel}}/dart-ffi/Struct-class.html)   | The supertype of all FFI struct types.                           |
| [Union]({{site.dart-api}}/{{site.data.pkg-vers.SDK.channel}}/dart-ffi/Union-class.html)     | The supertype of all FFI union types.                            |
{:.table .table-striped }

#### Purely marker native types

The following are platform-agnostic native types
that are used only as markers in type signatures,
and can't be instantiated in Dart code:

## Generating FFI bindings with `package:ffigen`

For large API surfaces it can be time-consuming
to write the Dart bindings that integrate with the C code.
To reduce this burden,
you can use the [`package:ffigen`][ffigen] binding generator
to automatically create FFI wrappers from C header files.
