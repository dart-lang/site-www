Over the past several years, we've written a ton of Dart code and learned a lot
about what works well and what doesn't. We're sharing this with you so you can
write consistent, robust, fast code too. There are two overarching themes:

 1. **Be consistent.** When it comes to things like formatting, and casing,
    arguments about which is better are subjective and impossible to resolve.
    What we do know is that being *consistent* is objectively helpful.

    If two pieces of code look different it should be because they *are*
    different in some meaningful way. When a bit of code stands out and catches
    your eye, it should do so for a useful reason.

 2. **Be brief.** Dart was designed to be familiar, so it inherits many of the
    same statements and expressions as C, Java, JavaScript and other languages.
    But we created Dart because there is a lot of room to improve on what those
    languages offer. We added a bunch of features, from string interpolation to
    initializing formals, to help you express your intent more simply and
    easily.

    If there are multiple ways to say something, you should generally pick the
    most concise one. This is not to say you should [code golf][] yourself into
    cramming a whole program into a single line. The goal is code that is
    *economical*, not *dense*.

## The guides

We split the guidelines into a few separate pages for easy digestion:

  * **[Style Guide][]** &ndash; This defines the rules for laying out and
    organizing code, or at least the parts that [dartfmt] doesn't handle for
    you. The style guide also specifies how identifiers are formatted:
    `camelCase`, `using_underscores`, etc.

  * **[Documentation Guide][]** &ndash; This tells you everything you need to
    know about what goes inside comments. Both doc comments and regular,
    run-of-the-mill code comments.

  * **[Usage Guide][]** &ndash; This teaches you how to make the best use of
    language features to implement behavior. If it's in a statement or
    expression, it's covered here.

  * **[Design Guide][]** &ndash; This is the softest guide, but the one
    with the widest scope. It covers what we've learned about designing
    consistent, usable APIs for libraries. If it's in a type signature or
    declaration, this goes over it.

For links to all the guidelines, see the
[summary](#summary-of-all-rules).

## How to read the guides

Each guide is broken into a few sections. Sections contain a list of guidelines.
Each guideline starts with one of these words:

* **DO** guidelines describe practices that should always be followed. There
  will almost never be a valid reason to stray from them.

* **DON'T** guidelines are the converse: things that are almost never a good
  idea. Hopefully, we don't have as many of these as other languages do because
  we have less historical baggage.

* **PREFER** guidelines are practices that you *should* follow. However, there
  may be circumstances where it makes sense to do otherwise. Just make sure you
  understand the full implications of ignoring the guideline when you do.

* **AVOID** guidelines are the dual to "prefer": stuff you shouldn't do but
  where there may be good reasons to on rare occasions.

* **CONSIDER** guidelines are practices that you might or might not want to
  follow, depending on circumstances, precedents, and your own preference.

This sounds like the police are going to beat down your door if you don't have
your laces tied correctly. Things aren't that bad. Most of the guidelines here
are common sense and we're all reasonable people. The goal, as always, is nice,
readable and maintainable code.

## Glossary

To keep the guidelines brief, we use a few shorthand terms to refer to different
Dart constructs.

* A **library member** is a top-level field, getter, setter, or function.
  Basically, anything at the top level that isn't a type.

* A **class member** is a constructor, field, getter, setter, function, or
  operator declared inside a class. Class members can be instance or static,
  abstract or concrete.

* A **member** is either a library member or a class member.

* A **variable**, when used generally, refers to top-level variables,
  parameters, and local variables. It doesn't include static or instance fields.

* A **type** is any named type declaration: a class, typedef, or enum.

* A **property** is a top-level variable, getter (inside a class or at the top
  level, instance or static), setter (same), or field (instance or static).
  Roughly any "field-like" named construct.
