The following information talks about the formal Dart language specification.
For a gentler introduction to the Dart language, see the
[Dart language tour](/guides/language/language-tour).

## Dart 2

Dart 2 has changed the Dart language in many ways,
some of which are not backward-compatible.
For additional details, please see the [Dart 2 changelog](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#200---2018-08-07).

The formal specification is still in the process of being completed.
For information about changes, see the following resources:

* [Dart language specification source file (TeX format)](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/blob/master/docs/language/dartLangSpec.tex)
* [Dart informal specifications](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/tree/master/docs/language/informal)
