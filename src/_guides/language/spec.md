Use this page to find the formal Dart language specification.
For a gentler introduction to Dart, see the
[language tour](/guides/language/language-tour).

## Dart 2

A formal Dart 2 specification is available in PDF format:

  * [Dart Programming Language Specification (Version 2.2)](/guides/language/specifications/DartLangSpec-v2.2.pdf)

Note: Dart 2 has changed the Dart language in many ways, some of which are not
backward-compatible. For details, see the [Dart 2 page](/dart-2).

### In-progress specification

The in-progress formal Dart language specification is written as a
[LaTeX file,](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/blob/master/docs/language/dartLangSpec.tex)
and is available as a [draft specification in PDF format.](https://spec.dart.dev/DartLangSpecDraft.pdf)

New language features are typically described using informal language feature specifications in the dart-lang/language repo:
  * [Accepted informal proposals](https://github.com/dart-lang/language/tree/master/accepted)
  * [Drafts of potential features](https://github.com/dart-lang/language/tree/master/working)

The formal Dart 1.x language specification is available from
