## Dart 2 changes

Dart 2 is changing the Dart language in many ways,
some of which are not backward-compatible.
For information about what is changing and the implementation status,
see the following resources:

* [Dart 2 Updates](/dart-2)
* [Dart Language and Library Newsletters](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/tree/master/docs/newsletter#dart-language-and-library-newsletters)
* [Language specification source file (TeX format)](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/blob/master/docs/language/dartLangSpec.tex)
* [Informal specifications](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/tree/master/docs/language/informal)


## Changes in the 4<sup>th</sup> edition

The 4<sup>th</sup> edition of the specification has fewer restrictions on mixins.
The restrictions on mixins up until this edition were:

* Mixins must inherit directly from Object.
* Mixins cannot contain super calls.
* Mixins cannot define constructors.

Only the last one, mixins cannot define constructors, remains.

## Changes in the 3<sup>rd</sup> edition

The 3<sup>rd</sup> edition of the specification added information
about the following new language features:

* Null-aware operators

* [Generalized tear offs](https://github.com/gbracha/generalizedTearOffs/blob/master/proposal.md)
