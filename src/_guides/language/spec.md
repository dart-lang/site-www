For a gentler introduction to Dart, see the
[language tour](/language).

## Dart 3

The Dart 3 language specification is in progress.
You can find the in-progress specification in PDF format:

* [Latest, in-progress specification][latest draft]
  (produced from a [LaTeX file][])

[latest draft]: https://spec.dart.dev/DartLangSpecDraft.pdf
[LaTeX file]: https://github.com/dart-lang/language/blob/main/specification/dartLangSpec.tex

New language features are typically described using
informal language feature specifications in the [dart-lang/language][] repo:

* [Accepted informal proposals][]
* [Drafts of potential features][]

[dart-lang/language]: https://github.com/dart-lang/language
[Accepted informal proposals]: https://github.com/dart-lang/language/tree/main/accepted
[Drafts of potential features]: https://github.com/dart-lang/language/tree/main/working

  Dart 3 changed the Dart language in a few ways,
  primarily requiring [sound null safety](/null-safety).
