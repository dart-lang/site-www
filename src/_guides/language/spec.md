Use this page to find the formal Dart language specification.
For a gentler introduction to Dart, see the
[language tour](/guides/language/language-tour).

## Dart 2

Dart 2 has changed the Dart language in many ways,
some of which are not backward-compatible.
For details, see the [Dart 2 page](/dart-2).

The formal Dart 2 language specification is not yet up-to-date.

### In-progress specification

New language features are typically described using informal language feature specifications.
These are located inside the dart-lang/language repo:
  * [accepted](https://github.com/dart-lang/language/tree/master/accepted): Accepted informal proposals
  * [working](https://github.com/dart-lang/language/tree/master/working): Drafts of potential features

The in-progress formal Dart language specification is written as a
[LaTeX file](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/blob/master/docs/language/dartLangSpec.tex),
and is available as a [draft specification in PDF format](https://dart-specification.firebaseapp.com/DartLangSpecDraft.pdf).

## Dart 1.x

The formal Dart 1.x language specification is available from
the Ecma International website:

* <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-408.pdf"
