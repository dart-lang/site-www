If you're having problems converting your code to strong mode,
this page can help. Be sure to also check out
[Strong Mode Dart](/guides/language/sound-dart) for an overview of what "sound
Dart" means, and how strong mode contributes to making Dart a sound
language.

For a complete list of sources about strong mode and sound Dart,
see [other resources](/guides/language/sound-dart#other-resources)
in [Strong Mode Dart](/guides/language/sound-dart).

## Troubleshooting

<a name="am-i-using-strong-mode"></a>
### Am I really using strong mode?

If you're not seeing strong mode errors or warnings,
make sure that you're using strong mode.
A good test is to add the following code to a file:

{:.fails-sa}
{% prettify dart %}
void test() {
  bool b = [0][0];
}
{% endprettify %}

If you're using strong mode, you'll see the following warning from the analyzer:

```nocode
[warning] A value of type 'int' can't be assigned to a variable of type 'bool'.
```

<a name="not-using-strong-mode"></a>
### I'm not using strong mode and I think I should be

Strong mode is enforced by the Dart analyzer.
How you troubleshoot strong mode depends on whether you are running
`dartanalyzer` from the command line, or via one of the JetBrains IDEs.

#### Command line analyzer

If you are running dartanalyzer from the command line and you don't see
expected strong mode errors, try the following:

- If your project contains an [analysis
  options file,](/guides/language/analysis-options#the-analysis-options-file)
  make sure you've specified `strong mode: true` correctly.
  For more information, see [Specifying strong
  mode.](/guides/language/analysis-options#specifying-strong-mode)
- Run the analyzer with the `--strong` tag:
  ```nocode
  dartanalyzer --strong <file-or-directory>
  ```

For information on how to set up an analysis options file,
see [Customize Static Analysis](/guides/language/analysis-options).

#### JetBrains IDEs

Make sure that you have an analysis options file with
[strong mode turned on](/guides/language/analysis-options#specifying-strong-mode).
This file needs to be placed in a content root, or in a parent
directory of your content root. The steps for viewing a project's
content root varies a bit for WebStorm and IntelliJ.

Note that a large project may have multiple content roots.
The following instructions describe how to see a list of content roots in
WebStorm or IntelliJ.

WebStorm
: In the **Preferences** panel (**WebStorm > Preferences**), click
  **Directories** from the list on the left.
  The **+Add Content Root** button in the column on the far right appears
  above the content roots, shown in bold.

IntelliJ
: In the **Project Structure** panel (**File > Project Structure**),
  **Modules** is selected from the list on the left by default.
  The **+Add Content Root** button in the column on the far right appears
  above the content roots, shown in bold.

For more information on where to put your analysis options file, see
[the analysis options file](/guides/language/analysis-options#the-analysis-options-file),
part of [Customize Static Analysis](/guides/language/analysis-options).

<a name="common-errors"></a>
## Static errors and warnings

This section shows how to fix some of the errors and warnings
you might see from the analyzer or an IDE with strong mode enabled.

Static analysis can't catch all errors.
For help fixing strong-mode errors that appear only at runtime,
see [Runtime errors](#common-errors-and-warnings).


<a name="undefined-member"></a>
### Undefined member

**Error:** <code>&lt;<em>member</em>&gt; isn't defined for the class &lt;<em>class</em>&gt;</code>

These errors usually appear in code where a variable is statically known
to be some supertype but the code assumes a subtype.

**Fix:** Replace the definition of the member with an explicit type
declaration or a downcast.

For example, the analyzer complains that `context2D` in the following
code is undefined:

{:.fails-sa}
{% prettify dart %}
var canvas = querySelector("canvas");
canvas.[!context2D!]; // <-- Error.
{% endprettify %}

The `querySelector()` method statically returns an Element,
but the code assumes it returns the subtype CanvasElement
where `context2D` is defined.
The `canvas` field is declared as `var` which, in classic Dart,
types it as `dynamic` and silences all errors.
Strong mode Dart infers `canvas` to be an Element.

Fix this error with an explicit type declaration:

{:.passes-sa}
{% prettify dart %}
[!CanvasElement!] canvas = querySelector("canvas");
canvas.context2D;
{% endprettify %}

If you actually want a dynamic type, specify `dynamic`:

{:.passes-sa}
{% prettify dart %}
[!dynamic!] canvas = querySelector("canvas");
canvas.context2D;
{% endprettify %}

<hr>

<a name="invalid-method-override"></a>
### Invalid method override

**Error:** <code>Invalid override. The type of &lt;<em>type</em>&gt; is not a subtype of &lt;<em>type</em>&gt;.</code>

These errors typically occur when a subclass tightens up a method's
parameter types by specifying a subclass of the original class.

<aside class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
**Note:** This warning can also occur when a generic subclass neglects
to specify a type. For more information, see
[Missing type arguments](#missing-type-arguments).
</aside>

**Fix:** Widen the types in the method's parameter list.
The subclass's method should accept every
object that the superclass's method takes.

In the following example, the parameters in the `add()` method
are changed from `num` to `int`, a subtype of `num`.
This code passes static analysis in classic Dart,
but is unsafe and fails analysis in strong mode Dart.

{:.fails-sa}
{% prettify dart %}
abstract class NumberAdder {
  num add(num a, num b);
}

class IntAdder extends NumberAdder {
  int add([!int!] a, [!int!] b) => a + b;
}
{% endprettify %}

Consider the following scenario where floating
point values are passed to an IntAdder:

{% prettify dart %}
NumberAdder adder = new IntAdder(); // Upcast
adder.add([!1.2!], [!3.4!]); // Kaboom!
{% endprettify %}

If the override were allowed, this code would crash at runtime.

Fix this error by widening the types in the subclass:

{:.passes-sa}
{% prettify dart %}
abstract class NumberAdder {
  num add(num a, num b);
}

class IntAdder extends NumberAdder {
  num add([!num!] a, [!num!] b) => a + b;
}
{% endprettify %}

For more information, see [Use proper input parameter types when overriding methods](/guides/language/sound-dart#use-proper-param-types).

<aside class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
  **Note:** If you have a valid reason to use a subtype, you can use the
  [covariant keyword](#the-covariant-keyword).
</aside>


<hr>

<a name="missing-type-arguments"></a>
### Missing type arguments

**Error:** <code>Invalid override. The type of &lt;<em>type</em>&gt; is not a subtype of &lt;<em>type</em>&gt;.</code>

**Fix:** Specify type arguments for the generic subclass.

When a generic subclass neglects to specify a type argument,
the analyzer infers the `dynamic` type. This is likely to cause
errors.

In the following example, `Subclass` extends `Superclass<T>` but doesn't
specify a type argument. The analyzer infers `Subclass<dynamic>`,
which results in an invalid override error on `method(int)`.

{:.fails-sa}
{% prettify dart %}
class Superclass<T> {
  void method(T t) {}
}

class Subclass extends Superclass {
  [!void method(int i) {}!] // <-- Error.
}
{% endprettify %}

You can fix this by specifying the type on the subclass:

{:.passes-sa}
{% prettify dart %}
class Superclass<T> {
  void method(T t) {}
}

class Subclass extends Superclass[!<int>!] {
  void method(int i) {}
}
{% endprettify %}

<hr>

<a name="assigning-mismatched-types"></a>
### Assigning mismatched types

**Warning:** <code>A value of type '&lt;<em>type</em>&gt;' cannot be
assigned to a variable of type '<em>type</em>'.</code>

This sometimes happens when you create a simple dynamic collection
and the analyzer Dart infers the type in a way you didn't expect.
When you later add values of a different type,
the analyzer produces a warning.

**Fix:** Specify the type explicitly.

For example, the following code initializes a map with several
(String, integer) pairs. The analyzer infers that map to be of type
`<String, int>` but the code assumes `<String, dynamic>`.
When the code then adds a (String, float) pair, the analyzer complains.

{:.fails-sa}
{% prettify dart %}
void main() {
  var map = {
    'a': 7,
    'b': 11,
    'c': 13
  }; // <= inferred to be Map<String, int>

  [!map['d'] = 1.5;!]  // 1.5 is not int!
}
{% endprettify %}

This can be fixed by explicitly defining the map's type to be
`<String, dynamic>`.

{:.passes-sa}
{% prettify dart %}
void main() {
  var map = [!<String, dynamic>!]{
    'a': 7,
    'b': 11,
    'c': 13
  };

  map['d'] = 1.5;
}
{% endprettify %}

Alternatively, if you only want this map to accept integers and floats,
you can specify the type as `<String, num>`.

<hr>

<a name="constructor-initialization-list"></a>
### Constructor initialization list super() call

**Error:**  <code>super call must be last in an initializer list
   (see https://goo.gl/EY6hDP): 'super(style)'.</code>

This error occurs when the `super()` call is not last in a constructor's
initialization list.

**Fix:** Put the `super()` call last.

The Dart dev compiler generates simpler code if
it relies on the `super()` call appearing last.
The following example generates an error in strong mode Dart:

{:.fails-sa}
{% prettify dart %}
HoneyBadger(Eats food, String name)
  : [!super!](food),
    _name = name { ... }
{% endprettify %}

Fix the error by moving the `super()` call:

{:.passes-sa}
{% prettify dart %}
HoneyBadger(Eats food, String name)
  : _name = name,
    [!super!](food) { ... }
{% endprettify %}

For more information, see [DO place the super() call last in a
constructor initialization list](/guides/language/effective-dart/usage#do-place-the-super-call-last-in-a-constructor-initialization-list)
in [Effective Dart](/guides/language/effective-dart/).

<hr>

<a name="uses-dynamic-as-bottom"></a>
### A function of type ... can't be assigned

In Dart 1.x `dynamic` was both a [top type][top_type_wiki] (also known as a
_universal supertype_, or the _supertype of all other types_) and a
[bottom type][bottom_type_wiki] (also known as the _zero_ or _empty_ type)
depending on the context. This meant it was legal to assign, for example,
a function with a parameter of type `String` to a place that expected a
function type with a parameter of `dynamic`.

[top_type_wiki]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_type
[bottom_type_wiki]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottom_type

However, in Dart 2 passing something other than `dynamic` (or another _top_
type, such as `Object`, or a specific bottom type, such as `Null`) fails at
compile-time (called `uses_dynamic_as_bottom`):

{:.fails-sa}
{% prettify dart %}
typedef bool Filter(dynamic any);

main() {
  Filter filter = (String x) => x.contains('Hello'); // <- Error
}
{% endprettify %}

**Error:** <code>A function of type '(String) → void' can't be assigned to a variable of type '(dynamic) → void'</code>

**Fix:** Add generic type parameters _or_ cast from dynamic explicitly instead.

One fix could be, if possible, typing `Filter` as `Filter<T>`:

{:.passes-sa}
{% prettify dart %}
typedef bool Filter<T>(T any);

main() {
  Filter<String> filter = (String x) => x.contains('Hello');
}
{% endprettify %}
                                                                   
If not possible, another alternative is casting:

{:.passes-sa}
{% prettify dart %}
typedef bool Filter(dynamic any);

main() {
  Filter filter = (x) => (x as String).contains('Hello');
}
{% endprettify %}

<hr>

<a name="common-errors-and-warnings"></a>
## Runtime errors

The strong-mode errors in this section can occur only when
you're using a strong mode runtime for Dart 2,
such as `dartdevc`, Flutter, or
the command-line Dart VM with `--strong` (where supported).

### Invalid casts

Unlike Dart 1.x, Dart 2 enforces a sound type system. This means (roughly)
you can't get into a situation where the value stored in some variable is
different than the variable's static type. Like most modern statically
typed langauges, Dart accomplishes this with a mixture of static
(compile-time) and dynamic (runtime) checking.

For example, this type error is detected at compile-time:

{:.fails-sa}
{% prettify dart %}
main() {
  List<int> numbers = [1, 2, 3];
  List<String> [!string = numbers!]; // <-- Static analysis error
}
{% endprettify %}

Since neither `List<int>` nor `List<String>` is a subtype of the other,
Dart rules this out statically. You can see other examples of these
static analysis errors in [Assigning Mismatched Types](#assigning-mismatched-types).

In other cases, however, Dart needs to insert a _runtime_ check. Consider:

{:.passes-sa}
{% prettify dart %}
assumeStrings(List<Object> objects) {
  List<String> [!strings = objects!]; // <- Implicit downcast
  String string = strings[0];         // Expect to get a type 'String' out.
}
{% endprettify %}

The second line above is _downcasting_ the `List<Object>` to `List<String>`
implicitly (as if you wrote `as List<String>`), so if the value you pass to
`objects` at runtime actually is a `List<String>`, the cast succeeds.

But if not, the cast will fail at runtime:

```dart
// Will fail at runtime.
assumeStrings(<int>[1, 2, 3]);
```

**Error:** <code>Invalid cast. The type of &lt;<em>List&lt;int&gt;</em>&gt; is not a subtype of &lt;<em>List&lt;String&gt;</em>&gt;.</code>

**Fix:** Tighten or correct the type of the object, if possible.
Otherwise, create a new object of the correct type.

<aside class="alert alert-warning" markdown="1">
  **Note for `dartdevc` users:**
  The `dartdevc` compiler in `2.0.0-dev` releases currently ignores _some_
  common type errors to make migrations easier. We expect to enforce all
  errors by the final release.

TODO: Update that link once 2.0 is stable. Maybe create/use a macro for dev API docs.
{% endcomment %}

Sometimes, lack of a type, especially with empty collections, means that a `<dynamic>`
collection is created, instead of the typed one you intended. Adding an explicit
type argument can help:

{:.runtime-success}
{% prettify dart %}
  var list  = [!<String>[]!]; // <-- Give it an explicit type.
  list.add('a string');
  list.add('another');
  assumeStrings(list);
{% endprettify %}

You can also more precisely type the local variable, and let inference help:

{:.runtime-success}
{% prettify dart %}
  List[!<String>!] list  = []; // <-- Give it an explicit left-hand type.
  list.add('a string');
  list.add('another');
  assumeStrings(list);
{% endprettify %}

In cases where you are working with a collection that you don't create, such
as from JSON or an external data source, you can use the
[cast()]({{site.dart_api}}/dev/dart-core/List/cast.html) method
provided by `List` (and other collection classes).

Here's an example of the preferred solution: tightening the object's type.

{:.runtime-success}
{% prettify dart %}
main() {
  Map<String, dynamic> json = getFromExternalSource();
  var names = json['names'] as List;
  assumeStrings(names.[!cast!]<String>());
}
{% endprettify %}

<aside class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
  **Version note:**
  The `cast` method was introduced in 2.0.0-dev.22.0.
</aside>

If you can't tighten the type or use `cast`, you can copy the object
in a different way. For example:

{% prettify dart %}
main() {
  Map<String, dynamic> json = getFromExternalSource();
  var names = json['names'] as List;
  // Use `as` and `toList` until 2.0.0-dev.22.0, when `cast` is available:
  assumeStrings(names.map((name) => name [!as!] String).toList());
}
{% endprettify %}

### The covariant keyword

Some (rarely used) coding patterns rely on tightening a type
by overriding a parameter's type with a subtype, which is illegal in strong
mode Dart. In this case, you can use the `covariant` keyword to
tell the analyzer that you are doing this intentionally.
This removes the static error and instead checks for an invalid
parameter type at runtime.

<aside class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
  **Version note:**
  The `covariant` keyword was introduced in 1.22.
  It replaces the `@checked` annotation.
</aside>

The following shows how you might use `covariant`:

{% prettify dart %}
[!import 'package:meta/meta.dart';!]

class Animal {
  void chase(Animal x) {}
}

class Mouse extends Animal {}

class Cat extends Animal {
  void chase([!covariant!] Mouse x) {}
}
{% endprettify %}

Although this example shows using `covariant` in the subtype,
the `covariant` keyword can be placed in either the superclass
or the subclass method.
Usually the superclass method is the best place to put it.
The `covariant` keyword applies to a single parameter and is
also supported on setters and fields.
