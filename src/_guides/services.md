## Google API access

To access various Google Cloud APIs -- such as Google Docs API, YouTube Data
API, Cloud Translation API, and Cloud Storage API -- from a Dart client, you can
use [`package:googleapis`][]. This has client interfaces for more than 180
Google APIs.

## Firebase

For Flutter apps written in Dart, there is a large selection of Flutter plugins
supporting popular Firebase products such as Analytics, Cloud Firestore, Could
Functions, and Crashalytics. See [FlutterFire][] for more details.

For terminal apps, scripts, etc. written in Dart, the community-supported
[`package:firebase`][] might serve your needs.
