The Dart ecosystem uses _packages_ to manage shared software
such as libraries and tools.
To get Dart packages, you use the **pub package manager**.
You can find publicly available packages on the [**Pub site**,]({{site.pub}})
or you can load packages from the local file system or elsewhere,
such as Git repositories.
Wherever your packages come from, pub manages version dependencies,
helping you get package versions that work with each other and
with your SDK version.

Most [Dart-savvy IDEs][] offer support for using pub that
includes creating, downloading, updating, and publishing packages.
Or you can use [`pub` on the command line](/tools/pub/cmd).

At a minimum,
a Dart package is a directory containing a [pubspec file](/tools/pub/pubspec).
The pubspec contains some metadata about the package. Additionally,
a package can contain dependencies (listed in the pubspec),
Dart libraries, apps, resources, tests, images, and examples.

To use a package, do the following:

* Create a pubspec (a file named `pubspec.yaml` that lists package dependencies and includes
  other metadata, such as a name for your package).
* Use pub to get your package's dependencies.
* If your Dart code depends on a library in the package, import the library.

## Creating a pubspec

The pubspec is a file named <code class="literal">pubspec.yaml</code>
that's in the top directory of your application.
The simplest possible pubspec lists only the package name:

{% comment %} TODO: make 3-backtick-yaml the same as prettify yaml {% endcomment %}
{% prettify yaml %}
name: my_app
{% endprettify %}

Here is an example of a pubspec that declares dependencies on
two packages (`js` and `intl`) that are hosted on the Pub site:

{% prettify yaml %}
name: my_app
dependencies:
  js: ^0.6.0
  intl: ^0.15.8
{% endprettify %}

For details on creating a pubspec,
see the [pubspec documentation](/tools/pub/pubspec)
and the documentation for the packages that you want to use.

## Getting packages

Once you have a pubspec, you can run <code class="literal">pub
get</code> from the top directory of your application:

```terminal
$ cd <path-to-my_app>
$ pub get
```

This process is called _getting the dependencies_.

The `pub get` command determines which packages your app depends on,
and puts them in a central [system cache](/tools/pub/glossary#system-cache).
If your app depends on a published package, pub downloads that package from the
[Pub site.]({{site.pub}})
For a [Git dependency](/tools/pub/dependencies#git-packages),
pub clones the Git repository.
Transitive dependencies are included, too.
For example, if the `js` package depends on the `test` package, `pub`
grabs both the `js` package and the `test` package.

Pub creates a
`.packages` file (under your appâ€™s top directory)
that maps each package name
that your app depends on to the corresponding package in the system cache.

## Importing libraries from packages

To import libraries found in packages, use the
<code class="literal">package:</code> prefix:

```dart
import 'package:js/js.dart' as js;
import 'package:intl/intl.dart';
```

The Dart runtime takes everything after `package:`
and looks it up within the `.packages` file for
your app.

You can also use this style to import libraries from within your own package.
Consider the following pubspec file, which declares a dependency on
the (fictional) `transmogrify` package:

{% prettify yaml %}
name: my_app
dependencies:
  transmogrify:
{% endprettify %}

Let's say that your package is laid out as follows:

{% prettify none %}
transmogrify/
  lib/
    transmogrify.dart
    parser.dart
  test/
    parser/
      parser_test.dart
{% endprettify %}

The `parser_test` file *could* import `parser.dart` like this:

{% prettify dart %}
import '../../lib/parser.dart';
{% endprettify %}

But that's a fragile relative path. If `parser_test.dart` ever moves
up or down a directory, that path breaks.
Instead, you can do as follows:

{% prettify dart %}
import 'package:transmogrify/parser.dart';
{% endprettify %}

This way, the import can always get to `parser.dart` regardless of where the
importing file is.

## Upgrading a dependency

The first time you get a new dependency for your package,
pub downloads the latest version of it that's compatible with
your other dependencies.
It then locks your package to *always* use that version by
creating a **lockfile**.
This is a file named `pubspec.lock` that pub creates and stores next to your
pubspec. It lists the specific versions of each dependency (immediate and
transitive) that your package uses.

If your package is an application package,
you should check this file into
[source control](/guides/libraries/private-files).
That way, everyone working on your app uses the same versions
of all of the packages.
Checking in the lockfile also ensures that your deployed app
uses the same versions of code.

When you're ready to upgrade your dependencies to the latest versions,
use pub upgrade:

{% prettify sh %}
$ pub upgrade
{% endprettify %}

That command tells pub to regenerate the lockfile, using the newest
available versions of your package's dependencies.
If you want to upgrade only one dependency,
you can specify the package to upgrade:

{% prettify sh %}
$ pub upgrade transmogrify
{% endprettify %}

That command upgrades `transmogrify` to the latest version
but leaves everything else the same.
