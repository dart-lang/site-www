Most traditional conference sessions are videotaped and uploaded to sites
like YouTube, so the main benefit of traveling to and attending a conference
is the chance to meet and interact with other attendees and speakers,
and to participate in open discussions with people with whom you share
interests.

An unconference (AKA a “barcamp”) is a set of special conference sessions
where the conference attendees come up with session ideas and the sessions
are more like discussions than presentations. The idea is to provide a more
interactive experience compared to just attending talks with slides.
For many people, the unconference sessions are the highlight of a conference.

We are having a short unconference at the end of DartConf '18. We hope you
participate, both by suggesting unconference sessions, and attending these
sessions.

## Creating a session

First, you do not need to be an expert in a topic in order to create a
session for it. In fact, some of the best unconference sessions are created
by people who merely want to learn more about some new thing. If you know
someone who does know about the subject you can invite them to come and
participate in the session, but that is not required.

Unconference sessions are interactive, with lively discussions and sharing.
If you just want to give a talk or quickly demo a project you have built,
you should probably give a lightning talk instead (unless the idea is to
have an open discussion about your project). The creator of the session
should learn as much as the other session attendees.

Unconference sessions are also good places to develop ideas. I’ve even seen
unconference sessions that result in new ideas being implemented by the
participants. Be open to ideas from the attendees.

During the session, it is a good idea to make sure that everyone has a
chance to contribute. A session should not become dominated by a small
number of people (to the exclusion of others). Look around to see if
there are people who look like they have an idea to contribute, but are
shy or uncomfortable speaking in public. Ask them if they want to share
their ideas or questions.

Expect people to come and go from your session. This is called the [law of two
feet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology#Law_of_two_feet).

## Ideas for sessions

If you give a regular talk at DartConf and people have lots of questions
they don’t get to ask, feel free to create an unconference session where
people can come ask their questions or give feedback.

Most of the rooms available for the unconference hold less than two dozen
people, so don’t be afraid to create a session that may attract only a
small number of people. If you overflow a room, feel free to move it to
some other available space.

Pick topics you always wanted to hear at a conference. This is your big
chance&mdash;do it now!

Optionally, feel free to start with a 5 minute introduction to get the ball
rolling. This could be just bringing up some questions you would like
answered.

Good topics include an implicit call to action. For example, instead of
having a topic like "Let’s talk about Dart on the web" try something like
"Experiences with Dart on the web: success stories, failures, and near
misses."
