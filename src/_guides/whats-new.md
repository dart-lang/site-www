### Docs updated or added to dart.dev
{: .no_toc}

In addition to bug fixes and small improvements,
we made the following changes to this site:

* Added a [`dart` tool page][dart-tool]
  to document the new command-line interface to the Dart SDK.
  The new `dart` tool is analogous to the `flutter` tool in the Flutter SDK.
  Previously, the `dart` command only ran command-line apps.
  We updated the previous `dart` page accordingly
  and plan to update references to other tools over time.
* Updated the [package changelog documentation][changelog-docs]
  to recommend a standard format for `CHANGELOG.md` files.
  This new format lets tools
  (such as the relaunched pub.dev)
  parse changelogs.
* Changed an [Effective Dart][] guideline to favor
  using `Object` instead of `dynamic`.
  For details, see the revised guideline
  [AVOID using `dynamic` unless you want to disable static checking.][dynamic]
* Updated the [diagnostic messages page][diagnostics] to
  include more messages produced by the Dart analyzer.
* Updated the [evolution page][evolution]
  to include 2.9 and 2.10.
* Reorganized the [language specification page][spec]
  to make it easier to find the PDF version of
  the latest, in-progress specification.
* Added or updated docs related to [sound null safety][],
  a feature that's coming to the Dart language:
  * Clarified how to use [experiment flags with IDEs][experiments].
  * Updated the null safety page, adding information about
    [how to enable null safety][ns-enable].
  * Added a deep dive into null safety,
    [Understanding null safety][],
    written by Dart engineer Bob Nystrom.
