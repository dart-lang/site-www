We recommend the [Flutter framework][] for developing multi-platform native apps
for mobile (iOS & Android), desktop (Windows, Linux, and macOS), and the web.

Flutter is powered by the [Dart platform][].
The [Dart VM](/overview#platform) provides an instant _hot reload_ developer cycle.
The Dart compilers—an [ahead-of-time (AOT) compiler][] for native code
and a [Dart-to-JavaScript compiler][] for web code—create 
fast production code for any platform.
