In this chapter, you'll learn how to write tests for your Dart code. Testing is
crucial for ensuring that your application behaves as expected and remains
stable as you make changes. You'll use the `package:test` library, a popular
testing framework for Dart, to write unit tests for the data models you created
in the previous chapter.

:::secondary What you'll learn

*   Install and import the `package:test` library.
*   Write tests using `group`, `test`, `expect`, and matchers.
*   Create test files and organize tests.
*   Write tests for JSON deserialization logic.

:::

## Prerequisites

Before you begin this chapter, ensure you:

*   Have completed Chapter 9 and have a working Dart development environment with
    the `dartpedia` project.
*   Are familiar with basic programming concepts like variables, functions, and
    control flow.
*   Understand the purpose of testing in software development.

## Tasks

In this chapter, you will add tests to the `wikipedia` package, ensuring that
the JSON deserialization logic for your data models is working correctly.

### Task 1: Add the test dependency

First, you need to confirm that the `test` package is already a development
dependency in your project.

1.  Open the `wikipedia/pubspec.yaml` file within your project.
1.  Locate the `dev_dependencies` section.
1.  Verify that `test: ^1.24.0` (or the latest stable version) is present under
    `dev_dependencies`.

    ```yaml
    dev_dependencies:
      lints: ^5.0.0
      test: ^1.24.0
    ```

    If the `test` dependency is missing, add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. The
    `^` symbol allows compatible versions to be used.

1.  If you made any changes to the file, save `pubspec.yaml` and run
    `dart pub get` in your terminal from the `wikipedia` directory. This command
    fetches any newly added dependencies and makes them available for use in
    your project.

    You should see output similar to this:

    ```bash
    Resolving dependencies...
    Downloading packages...
    + test 1.25.1
    Changed 2 dependencies!
    ```

### Task 2: Create a test file and add imports

Next, create a test file for your data models and add the necessary imports to
it.

1.  Navigate to the `wikipedia/test` directory.
1.  Create a new file named `model_test.dart` in this directory.
1.  Open the `wikipedia/test/model_test.dart` file and add the following
    `import` statements at the top of the file:

    ```dart
    import 'dart:convert';
    import 'dart:io';

    import 'package:test/test.dart';
    import 'package:wikipedia/src/model/article.dart';
    import 'package:wikipedia/src/model/search_results.dart';
    import 'package:wikipedia/src/model/summary.dart';

    const String dartLangSummaryJson = './test/test_data/dart_lang_summary.json';
    const String catExtractJson = './test/test_data/cat_extract.json';
    const String openSearchResponse = './test/test_data/open_search_response.json';
    ```

    These lines import the `test` package, which provides the testing
    framework, and the data model files you want to test. The constant strings
    declare the location of your sample data.

### Task 3: Create the test data files

The tests you need to write rely on local JSON files that mimic the
responses from the Wikipedia API. You need to create a
`test_data` directory and populate it with three files.

1.  Navigate to the `wikipedia/test` directory.

1.  Create a new directory named `test_data`.

1.  Inside the `test_data` directory, create a new file named
    `dart_lang_summary.json` and paste the following content into it:

    ```json
    {
    "type": "standard",
    "title": "Dart (programming language)",
    "displaytitle": "<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Dart (programming language)</span>",
    "namespace": {
        "id": 0,
        "text": ""
    },
    "wikibase_item": "Q406009",
    "titles": {
        "canonical": "Dart_(programming_language)",
        "normalized": "Dart (programming language)",
        "display": "<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Dart (programming language)</span>"
    },
    "pageid": 33033735,
    "lang": "en",
    "dir": "ltr",
    "revision": "1259309990",
    "tid": "671bc7c6-aa67-11ef-aa2a-7c1da4fbe8fb",
    "timestamp": "2024-11-24T13:24:16Z",
    "description": "Programming language",
    "description_source": "local",
    "content_urls": {
        "desktop": {
        "page": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dart_(programming_language)",
        "revisions": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dart_(programming_language)?action=history",
        "edit": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dart_(programming_language)?action=edit",
        "talk": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Dart_(programming_language)"
        },
        "mobile": {
        "page": "https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dart_(programming_language)",
        "revisions": "https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Dart_(programming_language)",
        "edit": "https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dart_(programming_language)?action=edit",
        "talk": "https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Dart_(programming_language)"
        }
    },
    "extract": "Dart is a programming language designed by Lars Bak and Kasper Lund and developed by Google. It can be used to develop web and mobile apps as well as server and desktop applications.",
    "extract_html": "<p><b>Dart</b> is a programming language designed by Lars Bak and Kasper Lund and developed by Google. It can be used to develop web and mobile apps as well as server and desktop applications.</p>"
    }
    ```

1.  Next, create a file named `cat_extract.json`. This file is very long, so copy
    the contents from this link: https://github.com/ericwindmill/dash_getting_started/blob/main/dart_step_by_step/step_10/wikipedia/test/test_data/cat_extract.json

1.  Next, create a file named `open_search_response.json` and paste this content
    into it:

    ```json
    [
        "dart",
        [
            "Dart",
            "Darth Vader",
            "Dartmouth College",
            "Darts",
            "Darth Maul",
            "Dartford Crossing",
            "Dart (programming language)",
            "Dartmouth College fraternities and sororities",
            "Dartmoor",
            "Dartmouth, Massachusetts"
        ],
        [
            "",
            "",
            "",
            "",
            "",
            "",
            "",
            "",
            "",
            ""
        ],
        [
            "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dart",
            "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darth_Vader",
            "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmouth_College",
            "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darts",
            "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darth_Maul",
            "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartford_Crossing",
            "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dart_(programming_language)",
            "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmouth_College_fraternities_and_sororities",
            "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmoor",
            "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmouth,_Massachusetts"
        ]
    ]
    ```

With these files in place, you're ready to write the tests that will verify your
data models.

### Task 4: Write tests for JSON deserialization

Now, you'll write tests for the JSON deserialization logic in your data models.
You'll use the `group`, `test`, and `expect` functions from the `test` package.

1.  Use the `group` function to group related tests together.
    Add the following to your `wikipedia/test/model_test.dart` file:

    ```dart
    void main() {
      group('deserialize example JSON responses from wikipedia API', () {
        // Tests will go here
      });
    }
    ```

    The `group` function takes a description of the group and a callback
    function that contains the tests.

1.  Create a test for the `Summary` model.
    Add the following `test` function inside the `group` function:

    ```dart
    void main() {
      group('deserialize example JSON responses from wikipedia API', () {
        test('deserialize Dart Programming Language page summary example data from '
            'json file into a Summary object', () async {
          final String pageSummaryInput =
              await File(dartLangSummaryJson).readAsString();
          final Map<String, Object?> pageSummaryMap =
              jsonDecode(pageSummaryInput) as Map<String, Object?>;
          final Summary summary = Summary.fromJson(pageSummaryMap);
          expect(summary.titles.canonical, 'Dart_(programming_language)');
        });
      });
    }
    ```

    This `test` function does the following:

    *   Reads the contents of the `dart_lang_summary.json` file.
    *   Decodes the JSON string into a `Map<String, Object?>`.
    *   Creates a `Summary` object from the map using the `Summary.fromJson`
        constructor.
    *   Uses the `expect` function to assert that the `canonical` property of
        the `titles` object is equal to `'Dart_(programming_language)'`.

    The `expect` function takes a value and a matcher. The matcher is used to
    assert that the value meets certain criteria. In this case, the
    `equals` matcher is used to assert that the value is equal to a specific
    string.

1.  Create a test for the `Article` model. Add the following `test` function
    inside the `group` function, after the previous test:

    ```dart
    void main() {
      group('deserialize example JSON responses from wikipedia API', () {
        test('deserialize Dart Programming Language page summary example data from '
            'json file into a Summary object', () async {
          final String pageSummaryInput =
              await File(dartLangSummaryJson).readAsString();
          final Map<String, Object?> pageSummaryMap =
              jsonDecode(pageSummaryInput) as Map<String, Object?>;
          final Summary summary = Summary.fromJson(pageSummaryMap);
          expect(summary.titles.canonical, 'Dart_(programming_language)');
        });

        test('deserialize Cat article example data from json file into '
            'an Article object', () async {
        final String articleJson = await File(catExtractJson).readAsString();
        final Map<String, Object?> articleMap =
            jsonDecode(articleJson) as Map<String, Object?>;

        final Map<String, Object?> pagesMap =
            (articleMap['query'] as Map)['pages'] as Map<String, Object?>;

        // The 'pagesMap' contains a single key (e.g., '6678').
        // We get the first (and only) value from that map.
        final Map<String, Object?> catArticleMap =
            pagesMap.values.first as Map<String, Object?>;

        final Article article = Article(
            title: catArticleMap['title'] as String,
            extract: catArticleMap['extract'] as String,
        );

        expect(article.title.toLowerCase(), 'cat');
        });
      });
    }
    ```

    This `test` function does the following:

    *   Reads the contents of the `cat_extract.json` file.
    *   Decodes the JSON string into a `List<Object?>`.
    *   Creates the `Article` object from the list using the
        `Article.listFromJson` constructor.
    *   Uses the `expect` function to assert that the `title` property of the
        first article is equal to `'cat'`.

1.  Create a test for the `SearchResults` model.
    Add the following `test` function inside the `group` function, after the
    previous test:

    ```dart
    void main() {
    group('deserialize example JSON responses from wikipedia API', () {
        test('deserialize Dart Programming Language page summary example data from '
            'json file into a Summary object', () async {
        final String pageSummaryInput =
            await File(dartLangSummaryJson).readAsString();
        final Map<String, Object?> pageSummaryMap =
            jsonDecode(pageSummaryInput) as Map<String, Object?>;
        final Summary summary = Summary.fromJson(pageSummaryMap);
        expect(summary.titles.canonical, 'Dart_(programming_language)');
        });

        test('deserialize Cat article example data from json file into '
            'an Article object', () async {
        final String articleJson = await File(catExtractJson).readAsString();
        final Map<String, Object?> articleMap =
            jsonDecode(articleJson) as Map<String, Object?>;

        final Map<String, Object?> pagesMap =
            (articleMap['query'] as Map)['pages'] as Map<String, Object?>;

        // The 'pagesMap' contains a single key (e.g., '6678').
        // We get the first (and only) value from that map.
        final Map<String, Object?> catArticleMap =
            pagesMap.values.first as Map<String, Object?>;

        final Article article = Article(
            title: catArticleMap['title'] as String,
            extract: catArticleMap['extract'] as String,
        );

        expect(article.title.toLowerCase(), 'cat');
        });

        test('deserialize Open Search results example data from json file '
            'into an SearchResults object', () async {
        final String resultsString =
            await File(openSearchResponse).readAsString();
        final List<Object?> resultsAsList =
            jsonDecode(resultsString) as List<Object?>;
        final SearchResults results = SearchResults.fromJson(resultsAsList);
        expect(results.results.length, greaterThan(1));
        });
    });
    }
    ```

    This `test` function does the following:

    *   Reads the contents of the `open_search_response.json` file.
    *   Decodes the JSON string into a `List<Object?>`.
    *   Creates a `SearchResults` object from the list using the
        `SearchResults.fromJson` constructor.
    *   Uses the `expect` function to assert that the `results` list has a
        length greater than `1`.

### Task 5: Run the tests

Now that you've written the tests, you can run them to verify that they pass.

1.  Open your terminal and navigate to the `wikipedia` directory.
1.  Run the command `dart test`.

    You should see output similar to this:

    ```bash
    00:02 +4: All tests passed!
    ```

    This confirms that all three tests are passing.
