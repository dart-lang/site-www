DartPad is a free, open source service to help developers learn about the Dart
language and libraries. Source code entered into DartPad may be sent to servers
running in Google Cloud to be analyzed for errors/warnings, compiled to
JavaScript, and returned to the browser.

Source code, or prompts used to generate source code
entered into DartPad may be stored, processed, and aggregated in
order to improve the user experience of DartPad and other Dart tools. For
example, we may use the source code to help offer better code completion
suggestions. The raw source code is deleted after no more than 60 days.

DartPad uses Google Analytics to report feature usage statistics.
This data is used to help improve Dart and Flutter tools over time.
