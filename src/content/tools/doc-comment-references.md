Doc comments can contain references to various code elements. A library member
or class member, etc. can be referenced by wrapping its name in square brackets
(`[...]`) in a doc comment (a comment starting with `///`). Examples:

```dart
/// Returns a [String].
String f() => 'Hello';

/// Wraps [object] with [Future.value].
Future<T> g<T>(T object) => Future.value(object);
```

These doc comments contain references to the `String` class, the `object`
parameter, and the `Future.value` constructor.

## Features of references

There are several benefits to referring to a code element in a doc comment as a
doc comment reference:

### Editor features

Doc comment references enable several IDE features. When an element is renamed
via an IDE command, it can rewrite uses of that element, including references
in doc comments. When an IDE lists all "references" to an element, it can
include references in doc comments. An IDE can also provide Go-to-definition
support at the location of a doc comment reference.

### API documentation

In API documentation generated by `dart doc`, a doc comment reference is
linked, if possible, to the documentation page of the element being referenced.
If the element does not have a documentation page (for example, a function
parameter, a type variable, or a private class), then no link is created.

## What can be referenced

Most library members can be referenced in a doc comment, including classes,
constants, enums, named extensions, extension types, functions, mixins, and
type aliases. This includes all in-scope library members, either declared
locally, or imported. Library members which are imported with an import prefix
can be referenced with the prefix. Examples:

```dart
import 'dart:math' as math;

/// [List] is in scope.
/// So is [math.max].
int x = 7;
```

Most members of a class, an enum, an extension, an extension type, and a mixin
can also be referenced. A reference to a member that is not in scope must be
qualified with its container's name. For example the `wait` static method on
the `Future` class can be referenced in a doc comment with `[Future.wait]`.
This is true for instance members as well; the `add` method and the `length`
property on the `List` class can be referenced with `[List.add]` and
`[List.length]`. In-scope members like these can even be referenced without the
qualifying container name:

```dart
abstract class MyList<E> implements List<E> {
  /// Refer to [add] and [contains], which is declared on [Iterable].
  void myMethod() {}
}
```

The doc comment for a function can include references to the function's
parameters.

The doc comment for a class, enum, extension, extension type, method, mixin,
top-level function, and type alias can include references to its type
parameters.

The doc comment for a type alias cannot reference any of the aliased type's
members, if it has any, as if they were in scope.
