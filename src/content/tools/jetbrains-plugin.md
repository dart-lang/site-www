The [Dart plugin][] adds Dart support
to IntelliJ Platform-based IDEs developed by JetBrains.
These IDEs provide features unique to specific development technologies.
The IDEs recommended for Dart and Flutter development include:

- [IntelliJ IDEA][] which specializes in JVM-based language development.
- [WebStorm][] which specializes in web app development.
- [Android Studio][] which specializes in Android and Flutter development.

Whichever JetBrains IDE you choose for Dart development,
this page has resources to help you get started quickly
and find more information when you need it.

[WebStorm]: https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/
[Android Studio]: https://developer.android.com/studio

## Getting started

If you don't already have the IDE and the Dart SDK, get them.
Then install the Dart plugin and tell it where to find the Dart SDK.


### Downloading the IDE

Install a JetBrains IDE if you don't already have one. Choose one:

* [IntelliJ IDEA][IDEA-Install]{:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
* [IntelliJ IDEA EAP][IDEA-EAP-Install]{:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
  (for early access to the latest Dart language features and IntelliJ functionality)
* [WebStorm][WS-Install]{:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
* [Android Studio][AS-Install]{:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
* [Another JetBrains product][Other]{:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

[IDEA-Install]: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/
[IDEA-EAP-Install]: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/nextversion/
[WS-Install]: https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download/
[AS-Install]: https://developer.android.com/studio/install
[Other]: https://www.jetbrains.com/products.html

:::note
The Community Edition of IntelliJ IDEA has limited functionality.
For example, it doesn't directly support debugging web apps.
It also has very little support for JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and YAML.
:::


### Downloading the Dart SDK

If you don't already have the Dart SDK,
install it.
You can get it either by itself or by downloading the Flutter SDK,
which includes the full Dart SDK.

Choose one:

* [Download the Dart SDK](/get-dart)
* [Download the Flutter SDK]({{site.flutter-docs}}/get-started/install)


### Configuring Dart support

Here's one way to configure Dart support:

<ol>
<li>
  <p>
    Start the IDE, and install the <b>Dart</b> plugin.
  </p>

  <ol type="a">
    <li>From the Welcome screen, choose <b>Plugins</b>.</li>
    <li>Search for <b>Dart</b>.</li>
    <li>Once you've installed the Dart plugin, restart the IDE.</li>
  </ol>
</li>
<br>

<li>
  <p>
    Create a new Dart project:
  </p>

  <ol type="a">
    <li>From the Welcome screen, click <b>New Project</b>.</li>
    <li>In the next dialog, click <b>Dart</b>.</li>
  </ol>
</li>
<br>

<li>
  <p>
    If you don't see a value for the <b>Dart SDK</b> path,
    enter or select it.
  </p>

  <p>
    For example, the SDK path might be
    <code><em>&lt;dart installation directory></em>/dart/dart-sdk</code>.
  </p>

  :::note
  The **Dart SDK** specifies the directory that
  contains the SDK's `bin` and `lib` directories;
  the `bin` directory contains tools such as `dart` and `dartaotruntime`.
  The IDE ensures that the path is valid.
  :::
</li>

<li>
  <p>
    Choose a starting template.
  </p>

  <ol type="a">
    <li>To enable starting templates, click <b>Generate sample content</b>.</li>
    <li>Pick your desired template.</li>
  </ol>

  :::note
  The provided templates are supplied and created
  by [`dart create`](/tools/dart-create).
  :::
</li>

<li>
  <p>Click <b>Next</b> and continue project setup.</p>
</li>
</ol>

An alternative to Step 2 is to open an existing Dart project,
and then open its `pubspec.yaml` file or any of its Dart files.
