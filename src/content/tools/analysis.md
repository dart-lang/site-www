Static analysis allows you to find problems before
executing a single line of code. It's a powerful tool
used to prevent bugs and ensure that code conforms to style
guidelines.

With the help of the analyzer, you can find
simple typos. For example, perhaps an accidental semicolon
made its way into an `if` statement:


<blockquote class="ml-3">

<?code-excerpt "analysis/lib/lint.dart (empty_statements)" replace="/(if .*?)(;)/$1[!$2!]/g"?>
```dart showLineNumbers=8
void increment() {
  if (count < 10) [!;!]
  count++;
}
```

If properly configured, the analyzer points to the semicolon and
produces the following warning:

<?code-excerpt "analysis/analyzer-results-stable.txt" retain="empty_statements" replace="/lib\/lint.dart/example.dart/g"?>
```plaintext
info - example.dart:9:19 - Unnecessary empty statement. Try removing the empty statement or restructuring the code. - empty_statements
```

</blockquote>

The analyzer can also help you find more subtle problems.
For example, perhaps you've forgotten to close a sink method:

<blockquote class="ml-3">

<?code-excerpt "analysis/lib/lint.dart (close_sinks)" replace="/(contr.*?)(;)/[!$1!]$2/g"?>
```dart
var [!controller = StreamController<String>()!];
```

<?code-excerpt "analysis/analyzer-results-stable.txt" retain="close_sinks" replace="/-(.*?):(.*?):(.*?)-/-/g"?>
```plaintext
info - Unclosed instance of 'Sink'. Try invoking 'close' in the function in which the 'Sink' was created. - close_sinks
```

</blockquote>

In the Dart ecosystem,
the Dart Analysis Server and other tools use the
[analyzer package]({{site.pub-pkg}}/analyzer)
to perform static analysis.

You can customize static analysis to look for a variety of potential
problems, including errors and warnings specified in the
[Dart language spec](/guides/language/spec).
You can also configure linter rules,
to ensure that your code complies with the
[Dart Style Guide](/effective-dart/style)
and other suggested guidelines in [Effective Dart][]. 
Tools such as [`dart analyze`](/tools/dart-analyze),
[`flutter analyze`]({{site.flutter-docs}}/testing/debugging#the-dart-analyzer),
and [IDEs and editors](/tools#editors)
use the analyzer package to evaluate your code.

This document explains how to customize the behavior of the analyzer
using either an analysis options file or comments in Dart source code. If you want to
add static analysis to your tool, see the
[analyzer package]({{site.pub-pkg}}/analyzer) docs and the
[Analysis Server API Specification.](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/blob/main/pkg/analysis_server/doc/api.html)

:::note
To view various analyzer diagnostics with explanations and common fixes,
see [Diagnostic messages][diagnostics].
:::

## The analysis options file

Place the analysis options file, `analysis_options.yaml`,
at the root of the package, in the same directory as the pubspec file.

Here's a sample analysis options file:

<?code-excerpt "analysis_options.yaml" from="include" remove="implicit-dynamic" retain="/^$|\w+:|- cancel/" remove="https:"?>
```yaml title="analysis_options.yaml"
include: package:lints/recommended.yaml

analyzer:
  exclude: [build/**]
  language:
    strict-casts: true
    strict-raw-types: true

linter:
  rules:
    - cancel_subscriptions
```

The sample illustrates the most common top-level entries:

- Use <code>include: <em>url</em></code> to
  bring in options from the specified URL—in this case,
  from a file in the `lints` package.
  Because YAML doesn't allow duplicate keys,
  you can include at most one file.
- Use the `analyzer:` entry to customize static analysis:
  [enabling stricter type checks](#enabling-additional-type-checks),
  [excluding files](#excluding-files),
  [ignoring specific rules](#ignoring-rules),
  [changing the severity of rules](#changing-the-severity-of-rules), or
  [enabling experiments](/tools/experiment-flags#using-experiment-flags-with-the-dart-analyzer-command-line-and-ide).
- Use the `linter:` entry to configure [linter rules](#enabling-linter-rules).

:::warning
**YAML is sensitive to whitespace.** 
Don't use tabs in a YAML file,
and use 2 spaces to denote each level of indentation.
:::

If the analyzer can't find an analysis options file at the package root,
it walks up the directory tree, looking for one.
If no file is available, the analyzer defaults to standard checks.

Consider the following directory structure for a large project:

<img 
  src="/assets/img/guides/analysis-options-directory-structure.png"
  alt="project root contains analysis_options.yaml (#1) and 3 packages, one of which (my_package) contains an analysis_options.yaml file (#2).">

The analyzer uses file #1 to analyze the code in `my_other_package`
and `my_other_other_package`, and file #2 to analyze the code in
`my_package`.


## Enabling stricter type checks {:#enabling-additional-type-checks}

If you want stricter static checks than
the [Dart type system][type-system] requires,
consider enabling the 
`strict-casts`, `strict-inference`, and `strict-raw-types` language modes:

<?code-excerpt "analysis/analysis_options.yaml" from="analyzer" to="strict-raw-types" remove="exclude"?>
```yaml title="analysis_options.yaml"
analyzer:
  language:
    strict-casts: true
    strict-inference: true
    strict-raw-types: true
```

You can use the modes together or separately; all default to `false`.

`strict-casts: <bool>`
: A value of `true` ensures that the type inference engine never
  implicitly casts from `dynamic` to a more specific type.
  The following valid Dart code includes an implicit downcast from the
  `dynamic` value returned by `jsonDecode` to `List<String>`
  that could fail at runtime.
  This mode reports the potential error, 
  requiring you to add an explicit cast or otherwise adjust your code.

<?code-excerpt "analysis/lib/strict_modes.dart (strict-casts)" replace="/jsonDecode\(jsonText\)/[!$&!]/g"?>
```dart tag=fails-sa
void foo(List<String> lines) {
  ...
}

void bar(String jsonText) {
  foo([!jsonDecode(jsonText)!]); // Implicit cast
}
```

<?code-excerpt "analysis/analyzer-results-stable.txt" retain="The argument type 'dynamic' can't be assigned"  replace="/-(.*?):(.*?):(.*?)-/-/g"?>
```plaintext
error - The argument type 'dynamic' can't be assigned to the parameter type 'List<String>'. - argument_type_not_assignable
```

:::version-note
The `strict-casts` mode was introduced in Dart 2.16.
To enable similar checks with earlier SDK releases,
consider using the now deprecated `implicit-casts` option:

```yaml
analyzer:
  strong-mode:
    implicit-casts: false
```
:::

`strict-inference: <bool>`
: A value of `true` ensures that the type inference engine never chooses
  the `dynamic` type when it can't determine a static type.
  The following valid Dart code creates a `Map`
  whose type argument cannot be inferred, 
  resulting in an inference failure hint by this mode:

<?code-excerpt "analysis/lib/strict_modes.dart (strict-inference)" replace="/{}/[!$&!]/g"?>
```dart tag=fails-sa
final lines = [!{}!]; // Inference failure
lines['Dart'] = 10000;
lines['C++'] = 'one thousand';
lines['Go'] = 2000;
print('Lines: ${lines.values.reduce((a, b) => a + b)}'); // Runtime error
```
{:analyzer}

<?code-excerpt "analysis/analyzer-results-stable.txt" retain="The type argument(s) of 'Map'"  replace="/. Use.*'Map'. / /g; /-(.*?):(.*?):(.*?)-/-/g"?>
```plaintext
warning - The type argument(s) of 'Map' can't be inferred - inference_failure_on_collection_literal
```

:::tip
The `strict-inference` mode can identify many situations
which result in an inference failure.

See [Conditions for strict inference failure][] 
for an exhaustive list of inference failure conditions.
:::

[Conditions for strict inference failure]: https://github.com/dart-lang/language/blob/main/resources/type-system/strict-inference.md#conditions-for-strict-inference-failure

`strict-raw-types: <bool>`
: A value of `true` ensures that the type inference engine never chooses
  the `dynamic` type when it can't determine a static type
  due to omitted type arguments.
  The following valid Dart code has a `List` variable with a raw type,
  resulting in a raw type hint by this mode:

<?code-excerpt "analysis/lib/strict_modes.dart (strict-raw-types)" replace="/List n/[!List!] n/g"?>
```dart tag=fails-sa
[!List!] numbers = [1, 2, 3]; // List with raw type
for (final n in numbers) {
  print(n.length); // Runtime error
}
```

<?code-excerpt "analysis/analyzer-results-stable.txt" retain="The generic type" replace="/. Use explicit.*\. / /g; /-(.*?):(.*?):(.*?)-/-/g"?>
```plaintext
warning - The generic type 'List<dynamic>' should have explicit type arguments but doesn't - strict_raw_type
```

## Enabling and disabling linter rules {:#enabling-linter-rules}

The analyzer package also provides a code linter. A wide variety of
[linter rules][] are available. Linters tend to be
nondenominational—rules don't have to agree with each other.
For example, some rules are more appropriate for regular Dart packages
and others are designed for Flutter apps.
Note that linter rules can have false positives, unlike static analysis.

### Enabling Dart team recommended linter rules {:#lints}

The Dart team provides two sets of recommended linter rules
in the [lints package][]:

Core rules
: Help identify critical issues that are likely to lead to problems
  when running or consuming Dart code.
  All code should pass these linter rules.
  Packages that are uploaded to [pub.dev]({{site.pub}})
  have a [package score]({{site.pub}}/help/scoring)
  that's based in part on passing these rules.

Recommended rules
: Help identify additional issues
  that may lead to problems when running or consuming Dart code,
  and enforce a single, idiomatic style and format.
  We recommend that all Dart code use these rules,
  which are a superset of the core rules.

:::tip
If you're working on Flutter code, then instead of using the `lints` package, 
use [`flutter_lints`]({{site.pub-pkg}}/flutter_lints),
which provides a superset of the recommended rules.
:::

To enable either set of lints,
add the [lints package][] as a dev dependency:

```console
$ dart pub add --dev lints
```

Then edit your `analysis_options.yaml` file to include
your preferred rule set:

```yaml
include: package:lints/<RULE_SET>.yaml
```

For example, you can include the recommended rule set like this:

```yaml
include: package:lints/recommended.yaml
```

:::important
When a **new version of `lints`** is published,
code that previously passed analysis might **start failing analysis.**
We recommend updating your code to work with the new rules.
Other options are to explicitly enable individual linter rules 
or [disable individual rules][].
:::

[lints package]: {{site.pub-pkg}}/lints

### Enabling individual rules {:#individual-rules}

To enable a single linter rule, add `linter:` to the analysis options file
as a top-level key,
followed by `rules:` as a second-level key.
On subsequent lines, specify the rules that you want to apply,
prefixed with dashes (the syntax for a YAML list).
For example:

<?code-excerpt "analysis_options.yaml" from="linter:" take="12" remove="https:"?>
```yaml
linter:
  rules:
    - always_declare_return_types
    - cancel_subscriptions
    - close_sinks
    - combinators_ordering
    - comment_references
    - invalid_case_patterns
    - library_annotations
    - one_member_abstracts
    - only_throw_errors
```


### Disabling individual rules

If you include an analysis options file such as the one in `lints`,
you might want to disable some of the included rules.
Disabling individual rules is similar to enabling them,
but requires the use of a map rather than a list
as the value for the `rules:` entry,
so each line should contain the name of a rule followed by
either `: false` or `: true`.

Here's an example of an analysis options file
that uses all the recommended rules from `lints`
except `avoid_shadowing_type_parameters`.
It also enables the lint `await_only_futures`:

<?code-excerpt "analysis_alt/analysis_options_linter.yaml"?>
```yaml title="analysis_options.yaml"
include: package:lints/recommended.yaml

linter:
  rules:
    avoid_shadowing_type_parameters: false
    await_only_futures: true
```

:::note
Due to YAML restrictions,
**you can't mix list and key-value syntax in the same `rules` entry.**
You can use the other syntax for rules in an included file.
:::

## Enabling analyzer plugins (experimental) {:#plugins}

The analyzer has experimental support for plugins.
These plugins integrate with the analyzer to add functionality
such as new diagnostics, quick fixes, and custom code completion.
You can enable only one plugin per `analysis_options.yaml` file.
Enabling an analyzer plugin increases how much memory the analyzer uses.

Don't use analyzer plugins if your situation meets
either of the following conditions:

* You use a development machine with less than 16 GB of memory.
* You use a mono-repo with more than 10 `pubspec.yaml` and
  `analysis_options.yaml` files.
  
You can find a few analyzer plugins on
[pub.dev]({{site.pub-pkg}}?q=dependency%3Aanalyzer_plugin).

To enable a plugin:

 1. Add the package containing the plugin as a dev dependency.

    ```console
    $ dart pub add --dev <your_favorite_analyzer_plugin_package>
    ```

 2. Edit your `analysis_options.yaml` file to enable the plugin.

    ```yaml
    analyzer:
      plugins:
        - your_favorite_analyzer_plugin_package
    ```

    To indicate specific plugin functionality to enable,
    such as new diagnostics, additional setup might be required.

## Excluding code from analysis

Sometimes it's OK for some code to fail analysis.
For example, you might rely on code generated by a package that
you don't own—the generated code works,
but produces warnings during static analysis.
Or a linter rule might cause a false positive
that you want to suppress.

You have a few ways to exclude code from analysis:

* Exclude entire files from analysis.
* Stop specific non-error rules from being applied to individual files.
* Stop specific non-error rules from being applied to individual lines of code.

You can also [disable specific rules][disable individual rules]
for all files or
[change the severity of rules][].


### Excluding files

To exclude files from static analysis, use the `exclude:` analyzer option.
You can list individual files, or 
use [glob]({{site.pub-pkg}}/glob) pattern syntax.
All usages of glob patterns should be relative to the
directory containing the `analysis_options.yaml` file.

<?code-excerpt "analysis_alt/analysis_options.yaml (exclude)" plaster="none"?>
```yaml
analyzer:
  exclude:
    - lib/client.dart
    - lib/server/*.g.dart
    - test/_data/**
```

<a id="suppressing-rules-for-a-file"></a>
### Suppressing diagnostics for a file

To ignore a specific non-error diagnostic for a specific file,
add an `ignore_for_file` comment to the file:

<?code-excerpt "analysis/lib/assignment.dart (ignore_for_file)" replace="/, \w+//g"?>
```dart
// ignore_for_file: unused_local_variable
```

This acts for the whole file, before or after the comment, and is
particularly useful for generated code.

To suppress more than one diagnostic, use a comma-separated list:

<?code-excerpt "analysis/lib/assignment.dart (ignore_for_file)"?>
```dart
// ignore_for_file: unused_local_variable, duplicate_ignore, dead_code
```

To suppress all linter rules, add a `type=lint` specifier:

<?code-excerpt "analysis/lib/ignore_lints.dart (ignore_type_for_file)"?>
```dart
// ignore_for_file: type=lint
```

:::version-note
Support for the `type=lint` specifier was added in Dart 2.15.
:::

<a id="suppressing-rules-for-a-line-of-code"></a>
### Suppressing diagnostics for a line of code

To suppress a specific non-error diagnostic on a specific line of Dart code,
put an `ignore` comment above the line of code. 
Here's an example of ignoring code that causes a runtime error, 
as you might do in a language test:

<?code-excerpt "analysis/lib/assignment.dart (invalid_assignment)"?>
```dart
// ignore: invalid_assignment
int x = '';
```

To suppress more than one diagnostic, supply a comma-separated list:

<?code-excerpt "analysis/lib/assignment.dart (ignore-more)"?>
```dart
// ignore: invalid_assignment, const_initialized_with_non_constant_value
const x = y;
```

Alternatively, append the ignore comment to the line that it applies to:

<?code-excerpt "analysis/lib/assignment.dart (single-line)"?>
```dart
int x = ''; // ignore: invalid_assignment
```

### Suppressing diagnostics in a pubspec file

If you need to suppress a non-error diagnostic from the analyzer
in a `pubspec.yaml` file, add an `ignore` comment above the affected line.

The following example ignores the [`sort_pub_dependencies`][] lint
as it wants to put the `flutter` dependency first:

```yaml title="pubspec.yaml".
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter

  # ignore: sort_pub_dependencies
  collection: ^1.18.0
```

:::version-note
Support for ignore comments in `pubspec.yaml` files was added in Dart 3.3.
If you are using Dart 3.2 or earlier,
the ignored diagnostic will still be triggered.
:::

[`sort_pub_dependencies`]: /tools/linter-rules/sort_pub_dependencies

## Customizing analysis rules

Each [analyzer diagnostic][analyzer diagnostics] and
[linter rule][linter rules] has a default severity.
You can use the analysis options file to change
the severity of individual rules, or to always ignore some rules.

The analyzer supports three severity levels:

`info`
: An informational message that doesn't cause analysis to fail.
  Example: [`dead_code`][dead_code]

`warning`
: A warning that doesn't cause analysis to fail unless
  the analyzer is configured to treat warnings as errors.
  Example: [`invalid_null_aware_operator`][invalid_null_aware_operator]

`error`
: An error that causes analysis to fail.
  Example: [`invalid_assignment`][invalid_assignment]


### Ignoring rules

You can ignore specific [analyzer diagnostics][] and [linter rules][]
by using the `errors:` field.
List the rule, followed by <code>:&nbsp;ignore</code>. For example, the following
analysis options file instructs the analysis tools to ignore the TODO rule:

<?code-excerpt "analysis_alt/analysis_options.yaml (errors)" to="ignore"?>
```yaml
analyzer:
  errors:
    todo: ignore
```


### Changing the severity of rules

You can globally change the severity of a particular rule.
This technique works for regular analysis issues as well as for lints.
For example, the following analysis options file instructs the analysis tools to
treat invalid assignments as warnings and missing returns as errors,
and to provide information (but not a warning or error) about dead code:

<?code-excerpt "analysis_alt/analysis_options.yaml (errors)" remove="ignore"?>
```yaml
analyzer:
  errors:
    invalid_assignment: warning
    missing_return: error
    dead_code: info
```
