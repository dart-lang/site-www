This guide describes how to use the `dart compile` command
to compile a Dart program to a target platform.

## Overview

Use the `dart compile` command to compile
a Dart program to a [target platform](/overview#platform).
The output—which you specify using a subcommand—can 
either include a [Dart runtime][] or be a _module_
(also known as a _snapshot_).

{% render 'tools/dart-tool-note.md' %}

Here's an example of using the `exe` subcommand
to produce a self-contained executable file (`myapp.exe`):

```console
$ dart compile exe bin/myapp.dart
Generated: /Users/me/myapp/bin/myapp.exe
```

The next example uses the `aot-snapshot` subcommand to
produce an ahead-of-time (AOT) compiled module (`myapp.aot`).
It then uses the [`dartaotruntime` command](/tools/dartaotruntime)
(which provides a [Dart runtime][])
to run the AOT module:

```console
$ dart compile aot-snapshot bin/myapp.dart
Generated: /Users/me/myapp/bin/myapp.aot
$ dartaotruntime bin/myapp.aot
```

To specify the path to the output file,
use the `-o` or `--output` option:

```console
$ dart compile exe bin/myapp.dart -o bin/runme
```

For more options and usage information,
run `dart compile [<subcommand>] --help`:

```console
$ dart compile exe --help
```

The `dart compile` command replaces the
`dart2native`, `dart2aot`, and `dart2js` commands.

:::note
You don't need to compile Dart programs before running them.
Instead, you can use the [`dart run` command][dart-run],
which uses the Dart VM's JIT (just-in-time) compiler—a 
feature that's especially useful during development.
For more information on AOT and JIT compilation,
see the [platforms discussion](/overview#platform).
:::

Refer to the [native_app][] sample for a simple example of using `dart compile`
to compile a native app, 
followed by examples of running the app.

## Types of output

The following sections have details about each type of output
that `dart compile` can produce.


### Self-contained executables (exe) {:#exe}

The `exe` subcommand produces a standalone executable for
Windows, macOS, or Linux.
A **standalone executable** is native machine code that's compiled from
the specified Dart file and its dependencies,
plus a small [Dart runtime][] that handles
type checking and garbage collection.

You can distribute and run the output file like you would
any other executable file.

Compile your app and set the output file:

```console
$ dart compile exe bin/myapp.dart -o /tmp/myapp
```

When successful, this command outputs the following:

```console
Generated: /tmp/myapp
```

Run your compiled app from the `/tmp` directory:

```console
$ ./tmp/myapp
```

<a id="cross-compilation" aria-hidden="true"></a>

#### Cross-compilation {: #cross-compilation-exe }

:::version-note
Support for Linux ARM64 and x64 cross-compilation was introduced in Dart 3.8.

Support for Linux ARM and RISCV64 was introduced in Dart 3.9.
:::

The following table shows which 64-bit host operating systems support
cross-compilation to which targets:

{% assign y = '<span class="material-symbols system-support" title="Supported" aria-label="Supported">done</span>' %}

| 64-bit host OS | Linux ARM | Linux ARM64 | Linux RISCV64 | Linux x64 |
|----------------|-----------|-------------|---------------|-----------|
| Linux          |   {{y}}   |    {{y}}    |    {{y}}      |    {{y}}  |
| macOS          |   {{y}}   |    {{y}}    |    {{y}}      |    {{y}}  |
| Windows        |   {{y}}   |    {{y}}    |    {{y}}      |    {{y}}  |

{:.table .table-striped .nowrap}

To use cross-compilation, include the following flags:

`--target-os=linux`
: The target operating system for the compiled executable.
  Only the Linux operating system is supported at this time.

`--target-arch=value`
: The target architecture for the compiled executable.
  The value for this flag can be:

  - `arm`: 32-bit ARM processor
  - `arm64`: 64-bit ARM processor
  - `riscv64`: 64-bit RISC-V (RV64GC) processor
  - `x64`: x86-64 processor

The following command demonstrates how to cross-compile a
standalone executable for a 64-bit Linux system:

```console
dart compile exe \
  --target-os=linux \
  --target-arch=x64 \
  hello.dart
```

Internally, this command downloads additional Dart SDK binaries and
caches them in the `~/.dart` directory.

Here's a sample output with the `--verbose` flag specified with
the command:

```console
Downloading https://storage.googleapis.com/dart-archive/channels/dev/signed/hash/...4864.../sdk/gen_snapshot_macos_arm64_linux_x64...
Downloading https://storage.googleapis.com/dart-archive/channels/dev/raw/hash/...64e44.../sdk/dartaotruntime_linux_x64...

```

#### Signing

Executables created with `dart compile exe`
support signing on macOS and Windows.

To learn more about platform-specific code signing,
see the platform documentation for those operating systems:

* Windows [`SignTool.exe` documentation][]
* [Apple Code Signing guide][]

[`SignTool.exe` documentation]: https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/tools/signtool-exe
[Apple Code Signing guide]: {{site.apple-dev}}/support/code-signing/

#### Known limitations {: #known-limitations }

The `exe` subcommand has the following known limitations:

* No support for `dart:mirrors` and `dart:developer`.
  For a complete list of the core libraries you can use,
  reference the [Multi-platform][] and [Native platform][] library tables.

* Cross-compilation is supported, but the target OS is limited to Linux.
  To learn more, check out [Cross-compilation][].

[Multi-platform]: /libraries#multi-platform-libraries
[Native platform]: /libraries#native-platform-libraries
[Cross-compilation]: #cross-compilation-exe

### AOT modules (aot-snapshot) {:#aot-snapshot}

Use AOT modules to reduce disk space requirements when distributing
multiple command-line apps. The `aot-snapshot` subcommand produces an
output file specific to the current architecture on which you compile
your app.

For example, if you use macOS to create a `.aot` file,
then that file can run on macOS only.
Dart supports AOT modules on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Compile your app and set the output file:

```console
$ dart compile aot-snapshot bin/myapp.dart
```

When successful, this command outputs the following:

```console
Generated: /Users/me/myapp/bin/myapp.aot
```

Run your compiled app from the `/bin` directory:

```console
$ dartaotruntime bin/myapp.aot
```

To learn more, see the
[`dartaotruntime` documentation](/tools/dartaotruntime).

#### Cross-compilation {: #cross-compilation-aot }

Cross-compilation support for the `aot-snapshot` subcommand
is the same as what's available for the `exe` subcommand.
For more information, see
[Self-contained executables (exe)][cross-compile-exe].

[cross-compile-exe]: #cross-compilation-exe

#### Known limitations {: #known-limitations-aot }

The `aot-snapshot` subcommand has the same limitations
as the `exe` subcommand. For more information, see
[Self-contained executables (exe)][known-limitations-exe]

[known-limitations-exe]: #known-limitations

### JIT modules (jit-snapshot) {:#jit-snapshot}

JIT modules include all the parsed classes and compiled code that's
generated during a training run of a program.

```console
$ dart compile jit-snapshot bin/myapp.dart
Compiling bin/myapp.dart to jit-snapshot file bin/myapp.jit.
Hello world!
$ dart run bin/myapp.jit
Hello world!
```

When running from an application module,
the Dart VM doesn't need to parse or compile classes and functions that
were already used during the training run,
so the VM starts running user code sooner.

These modules are architecture specific,
unlike modules produced using the
[`kernel` subcommand](#kernel).


### Portable modules (kernel) {:#kernel}

Use the `kernel` subcommand to package up an app into a
single, portable file that
can be run on all operating systems and CPU architectures.
A kernel module contains a binary form of the abstract syntax tree
([Kernel AST][]) for a Dart program.

Here's an example of creating and running a kernel module:

```console
$ dart compile kernel bin/myapp.dart
Compiling bin/myapp.dart to kernel file bin/myapp.dill.
$ dart run bin/myapp.dill
```

Although kernel modules have reduced startup time compared to Dart code,
they can have much slower startup than architecture-specific AOT output formats.

[Kernel AST]: {{site.repo.dart.sdk}}/blob/main/pkg/kernel/README.md


### JavaScript (js) {:#js}

The `js` subcommand compiles Dart code to deployable JavaScript.

:::note
Use the [`webdev` tool][webdev] rather than running the 
Dart-to-JavaScript compiler.

* The [`webdev build`][] command, by default, produces minified, deployable JavaScript.

* The [`webdev serve`][] command, by default, produces JavaScript
  modules for running and debugging during development.
:::

{% render 'tools/dart-compile-js-options.md', site: site %}

#### Compiling web app example

For example, to compile a Dart application to optimized JavaScript, run
the following command:

```console
$ dart compile js -O2 -o out/main.js web/main.dart
```


#### Improving production web compilation {:#helping-generate-efficient-code}

Follow these practices to improve type inference, reduce file size, and
improve JavaScript performance:

* Don't use `Function.apply()`.
* Don't override `noSuchMethod()`.
* Avoid setting variables to `null`.
* Be consistent with the types of arguments
  you pass into each function or method.

:::tip
Don't worry about the size of your app's included libraries.
The production compiler performs tree shaking to omit
unused classes, functions, methods, and so on.
Import the libraries you think you'll need,
and let the compiler get rid of what it doesn't need.
