_Use relative imports for files in the 'lib' directory._

## Description

The analyzer produces this diagnostic when an `import` in a library inside
the `lib` directory uses a `package:` URI to refer to another library in
the same package.

## Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because it uses a `package:`
URI when a relative URI could have been used:

```dart
import 'package:my_package/bar.dart';
```

## Common fixes

Use a relative URI to import the library:

```dart
import 'bar.dart';
```
