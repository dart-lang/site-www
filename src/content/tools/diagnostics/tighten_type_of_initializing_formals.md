_Use a type annotation rather than 'assert' to enforce non-nullability._

## Description

The analyzer produces this diagnostic when an `assert` is being used in
the initializer list of a constructor to ensure that only a non-`null`
value is being used to initialize a field.

## Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because an `assert` is being
used to catch an error that could be caught by the type system:

```dart
class C {
  final String? s;

  C([!this.s!]) : assert(s != null);
}
```

## Common fixes

Remove the `assert` and add the non-nullable type before the initializing
formal:

```dart
class C {
  final String? s;

  C(String this.s);
}
```
