  diagnostic produced by the Dart analyzer.

_The null-check pattern will have no effect because the matched type isn't nullable._

## Description

The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a null-check pattern is used to
match a value that isn't nullable.

## Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because the value `x` isn't
nullable:

```dart
void f(int x) {
  if (x case var a[!?!] when a > 0) {}
}
```

## Common fixes

Remove the null-check pattern:

```dart
void f(int x) {
  if (x case var a when a > 0) {}
}
```
