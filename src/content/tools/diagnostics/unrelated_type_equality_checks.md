_The type of the operand ('{0}') isn't a subtype or a supertype of the value being matched ('{1}')._

_The type of the right operand ('{0}') isn't a subtype or a supertype of the left operand ('{1}')._

## Description

The analyzer produces this diagnostic when two objects are being compared
and neither of the static types of the two objects is a subtype of the
other.

Such a comparison will usually return `false` and might not reflect the
programmer's intent.

There can be false positives. For example, a class named `Point` might
have subclasses named `CartesianPoint` and `PolarPoint`, neither of which
is a subtype of the other, but it might still be appropriate to test the
equality of instances.

As a concrete case, the classes `Int64` and `Int32` from `package:fixnum`
allow comparing instances to an `int` provided the `int` is on the
right-hand side. This case is specifically allowed by the diagnostic, but
other such cases are not.

## Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because the string `s` is
being compared to the integer `1`:

```dart
bool f(String s) {
  return s [!==!] 1;
}
```

## Common fixes

Replace one of the operands with something compatible with the other
operand:

```dart
bool f(String s) {
  return s.length == 1;
}
```
