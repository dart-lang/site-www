_Instances of 'Color' should be created using an 8-digit hexadecimal integer (such as '0xFFFFFFFF')._

## Description

The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the argument to the constructor
of the `Color` class is a literal integer that isn't represented as an
8-digit hexadecimal integer.

## Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because the argument (`1`)
isn't represented as an 8-digit hexadecimal integer:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

Color c = Color([!1!]);
```

## Common fixes

Convert the representation to be an 8-digit hexadecimal integer:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

Color c = Color(0x00000001);
```
