_Invalid regular expression syntax._

## Description

The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the string passed to the
default constructor of the class `RegExp` doesn't contain a valid regular
expression.

A regular expression created with invalid syntax will throw a
`FormatException` at runtime.

## Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because the regular expression
isn't valid:

```dart
var r = RegExp([!r'('!]);
```

## Common fixes

Fix the regular expression:

```dart
var r = RegExp(r'\(');
```
