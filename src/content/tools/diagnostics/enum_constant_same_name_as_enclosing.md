_The name of the enum value can't be the same as the enum's name._

## Description

The analyzer produces this diagnostic when an enum value has the same name
as the enum in which it's declared.

## Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because the enum value `E` has
the same name as the enclosing enum `E`:

```dart
enum E {
  [!E!]
}
```

## Common fixes

If the name of the enum is correct, then rename the constant:

```dart
enum E {
  e
}
```

If the name of the constant is correct, then rename the enum:

```dart
enum F {
  E
}
```
