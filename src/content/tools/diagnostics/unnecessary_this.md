_Unnecessary 'this.' qualifier._

## Description

The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the keyword `this` is used to
access a member that isn't shadowed.

## Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because the use of `this` to
access the field `_f` isn't necessary:

```dart
class C {
  int _f = 2;

  int get f => [!this!]._f;
}
```

## Common fixes

Remove the `this.`:

```dart
class C {
  int _f = 2;

  int get f => _f;
}
```
