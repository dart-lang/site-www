_Use 'forEach' and a tear-off rather than a 'for' loop to apply a function to every element._

## Description

The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a `for` loop is used to operate
on every member of a collection and the method `forEach` could be used
instead.

## Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because a `for` loop is being
used to invoke a single function for each key in `m`:

```dart
void f(Map<String, int> m) {
  [!for (final key in m.keys) {!]
    [!print(key);!]
  [!}!]
}
```

## Common fixes

Replace the for loop with an invocation of `forEach`:

```dart
void f(Map<String, int> m) {
  m.keys.forEach(print);
}
```
