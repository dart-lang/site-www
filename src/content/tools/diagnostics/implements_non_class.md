_Classes and mixins can only implement other classes and mixins._

## Description

The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a name used in the `implements`
clause of a class or mixin declaration is defined to be something other
than a class or mixin.

## Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because `x` is a variable
rather than a class or mixin:

```dart
var x;
class C implements [!x!] {}
```

## Common fixes

If the name is the name of an existing class or mixin that's already being
imported, then add a prefix to the import so that the local definition of
the name doesn't shadow the imported name.

If the name is the name of an existing class or mixin that isn't being
imported, then add an import, with a prefix, for the library in which it's
declared.

Otherwise, either replace the name in the `implements` clause with the name
of an existing class or mixin, or remove the name from the `implements`
clause.
