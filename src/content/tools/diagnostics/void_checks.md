_Assignment to a variable of type 'void'._

## Description

The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a value is assigned to a
variable of type `void`.

It isn't possible to access the value of such a variable, so the
assignment has no value.

## Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because the field `value` has
the type `void`, but a value is being assigned to it:

```dart
class A<T> {
  T? value;
}

void f(A<void> a) {
  [!a.value = 1!];
}
```

The following code produces this diagnostic because the type of the
parameter `p` in the method `m` is `void`, but a value is being assigned
to it in the invocation:

```dart
class A<T> {
  void m(T p) { }
}

void f(A<void> a) {
  a.m([!1!]);
}
```

## Common fixes

If the type of the variable is incorrect, then change the type of the
variable:

```dart
class A<T> {
  T? value;
}

void f(A<int> a) {
  a.value = 1;
}
```

If the type of the variable is correct, then remove the assignment:

```dart
class A<T> {
  T? value;
}

void f(A<void> a) {}
```
