_Unnecessary use of getter and setter to wrap a field._

## Description

The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a getter and setter pair
returns and sets the value of a field without any additional processing.

## Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because the getter/setter pair
named `c` only expose the field named `_c`:

```dart
class C {
  int? _c;

  int? get [!c!] => _c;

  set c(int? v) => _c = v;
}
```

## Common fixes

Make the field public and remove the getter and setter:

```dart
class C {
  int? c;
}
```
