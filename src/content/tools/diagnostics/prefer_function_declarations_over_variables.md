_Use a function declaration rather than a variable assignment to bind a function to a name._

## Description

The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a closure is assigned to a
local variable and the local variable is not re-assigned anywhere.

## Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because the local variable `f`
is initialized to be a closure and isn't assigned any other value:

```dart
void g() {
  var [!f = (int i) => i * 2!];
  f(1);
}
```

## Common fixes

Replace the local variable with a local function:

```dart
void g() {
  int f(int i) => i * 2;
  f(1);
}
```
