_The diagnostic '{0}' isn't produced at this location so it doesn't need to be ignored._

_The diagnostic '{0}' isn't produced in this file so it doesn't need to be ignored._

## Description

The analyzer produces this diagnostic when an ignore is specified to
ignore a diagnostic that isn't produced.

## Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because the
`unused_local_variable` diagnostic isn't reported at the ignored location:

```dart
// ignore: [!unused_local_variable!]
void f() {}
```

## Common fixes

Remove the ignore comment:

```dart
void f() {}
```
