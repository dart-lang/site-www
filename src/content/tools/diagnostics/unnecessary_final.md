_Local variables should not be marked as 'final'._

## Description

The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a local variable is marked as
being `final`.

## Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because the local variable `c`
is marked as being `final`:

```dart
void f(int a, int b) {
  [!final!] c = a + b;
  print(c);
}
```

## Common fixes

If the variable doesn't have a type annotation, then replace the `final`
with `var`:

```dart
void f(int a, int b) {
  var c = a + b;
  print(c);
}
```

If the variable has a type annotation, then remove the `final`
modifier:

```dart
void f(int a, int b) {
  int c = a + b;
  print(c);
}
```
