_(Previously known as `continue_label_on_switch`)_

_The label used in a 'continue' statement must be defined on either a loop or a switch member._

## Description

The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the label in a `continue`
statement resolves to a label on a `switch` statement.

## Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because the label `l`, used to
label a `switch` statement, is used in the `continue` statement:

```dart
void f(int i) {
  l: switch (i) {
    case 0:
      [!continue l;!]
  }
}
```

## Common fixes

Find a different way to achieve the control flow you need; for example, by
introducing a loop that re-executes the `switch` statement.
