  diagnostic produced by the Dart analyzer.

_The redirecting constructor '{0}' can't redirect to a constructor of the abstract class '{1}'._

## Description

The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a constructor redirects to a
constructor in an abstract class.

## Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because the factory
constructor in `A` redirects to a constructor in `B`, but `B` is an
abstract class:

```dart
class A {
  factory A() = [!B!];
}

abstract class B implements A {}
```

## Common fixes

If the code redirects to the correct constructor, then change the class so
that it isn't abstract:

```dart
class A {
  factory A() = B;
}

class B implements A {}
```

Otherwise, change the factory constructor so that it either redirects to a
constructor in a concrete class, or has a concrete implementation.
