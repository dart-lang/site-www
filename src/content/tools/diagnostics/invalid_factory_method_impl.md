  diagnostic produced by the Dart analyzer.

_Factory method '{0}' doesn't return a newly allocated object._

## Description

The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a method that is annotated with
the [`factory`][meta-factory] annotation doesn't return a newly allocated
object.

## Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because the method `createC`
returns the value of a field rather than a newly created instance of `C`:

```dart
import 'package:meta/meta.dart';

class Factory {
  C c = C();

  @factory
  C [!createC!]() => c;
}

class C {}
```

## Common fixes

Change the method to return a newly created instance of the return type:

```dart
import 'package:meta/meta.dart';

class Factory {
  @factory
  C createC() => C();
}

class C {}
```
