_The pattern should be final._

_The variable '{0}' should be final._

## Description

The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the loop variable in a for-each
statement isn't marked as being `final`.

## Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because the loop variable `e`
isn't marked as being `final`:

```dart
void f(List<int> l) {
  for (var [!e!] in l) {
    print(e);
  }
}
```

## Common fixes

Add the modifier `final` to the loop variable, removing the `var` if there
is one:

```dart
void f(List<int> l) {
  for (final e in l) {
    print(e);
  }
}
```
