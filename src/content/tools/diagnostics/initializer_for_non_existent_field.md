_'{0}' isn't a field in the enclosing class._

## Description

The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a constructor initializes a
field that isn't declared in the class containing the constructor.
Constructors can't initialize fields that aren't declared and fields that
are inherited from superclasses.

## Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because the initializer is
initializing `x`, but `x` isn't a field in the class:

```dart
class C {
  int? y;

  C() : [!x = 0!];
}
```

## Common fixes

If a different field should be initialized, then change the name to the
name of the field:

```dart
class C {
  int? y;

  C() : y = 0;
}
```

If the field must be declared, then add a declaration:

```dart
class C {
  int? x;
  int? y;

  C() : x = 0;
}
```
