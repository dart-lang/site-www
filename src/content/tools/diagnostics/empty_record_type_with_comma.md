_A record type without fields can't have a trailing comma._

## Description

The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a record type that has no
fields has a trailing comma. Empty record types can't contain a comma.

## Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because the empty record type
has a trailing comma:

```dart
void f(([!,!]) r) {}
```

## Common fixes

If the record type is intended to be empty, then remove the comma:

```dart
void f(() r) {}
```

If the record type is intended to have one or more fields, then add the
types of those fields:

```dart
void f((int, int) r) {}
```
