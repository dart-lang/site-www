_Unnecessary 'late' modifier._

## Description

The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a top-level variable or static
field with an initializer is marked as `late`. Top-level variables and
static fields are implicitly late, so they don't need to be explicitly
marked.

## Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because the static field `c`
has the modifier `late` even though it has an initializer:

```dart
class C {
  static [!late!] String c = '';
}
```

## Common fixes

Remove the keyword `late`:

```dart
class C {
  static String c = '';
}
```
