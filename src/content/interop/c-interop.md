samples: "https://github.com/dart-lang/samples/tree/main/ffi"
---

Dart mobile, command-line, and server apps
running on the [Dart Native platform](/overview#platform)
can use the `dart:ffi` library to call native C APIs,
and to read, write, allocate, and deallocate native memory.
_FFI_ stands for [_foreign function interface._][FFI]
Other terms for similar functionality include
_native interface_ and _language bindings._

API documentation is available in the
[`dart:ffi` API reference.]({{site.dart-api}}/dart-ffi/dart-ffi-library.html)

## Download example files

To work with the examples in this guide,
download the full [ffi samples]({{samples}}) directory.
It includes the following examples show how to use the `dart:ffi` library:

### Review the hello_world example

The [hello_world example][hello_world] has the minimum necessary code
for calling a C library.
This example can be found in the `samples/ffi` you downloaded in the
previous section.

#### Files

The `hello_world` example has the following files:

| **Source file**                  | **Description**                                                                |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [`hello.dart`]                   | A Dart file that uses the `hello_world()` function from a C library.           |
| [`pubspec.yaml`]                 | The Dart [pubspec](/tools/pub/pubspec) file, with an SDK lower bound of 3.4.   |
| [`hello_library/hello.h`]        | Declares the `hello_world()` function.                                         |
| [`hello_library/hello.c`]        | A C file that imports `hello.h` and defines the `hello_world()` function.      |
| [`hello_library/hello.def`]      | A module-definition file which specifies information used when building a DLL. |
| [`hello_library/CMakeLists.txt`] | A CMake build file for compiling the C code into a dynamic library.            |

{:.table .table-striped }

[`hello.dart`]: {{hw}}/hello.dart
[`pubspec.yaml`]: {{hw}}/pubspec.yaml
[`hello_library/hello.h`]: {{hw}}/hello_library/hello.h
[`hello_library/hello.c`]: {{hw}}/hello_library/hello.c
[`hello_library/hello.def`]: {{hw}}/hello_library/hello.def
[`hello_library/CMakeLists.txt`]: {{hw}}/hello_library/CMakeLists.txt

Building the C library creates several files,
including a dynamic library file named
`libhello.dylib` (macOS),
`libhello.dll` (Windows), or
`libhello.so` (Linux).

#### Build and execute

The commands to build the dynamic library and execute the Dart app would
resemble the following series.

```console
$ cd hello_library
$ cmake .
...
$ make
...
$ cd ..
$ dart pub get
$ dart run hello.dart
Hello World
```

:::note
**On macOS,** executables, including the Dart VM (`dart`),
can load only **signed libraries.**
To learn more about signing libraries,

#### Leverage dart:ffi

To learn how to call a C function using the `dart:ffi` library,
review the [`hello.dart` file]({{hw}}/hello.dart).
This section explains the contents of this file.

1. Import `dart:ffi`.

   ```dart
   import 'dart:ffi' as ffi;
   ```

2. Import the path library that you'll use to store the path of dynamic library.

   ```dart
   import 'dart:io' show Platform, Directory;
   import 'package:path/path.dart' as path;
   ```

3. Create a typedef with the FFI type signature of the C function.  
   To learn about the most used types according to the `dart:ffi` library
   consult [Interfacing with native types](#interface-with-native-types).

   ```dart
   typedef hello_world_func = ffi.Void Function();
   ```

4. Create a `typedef` for the variable to use when calling the C function.

   ```dart
   typedef HelloWorld = void Function();
   ```

5. Create a variable to store the path of the dynamic library.

   ```dart
   var libraryPath = path.join(Directory.current.path, 'hello_library',
       'libhello.so');
   if (Platform.isMacOS) {
     libraryPath = path.join(Directory.current.path, 'hello_library',
         'libhello.dylib');
   } else if (Platform.isWindows) {
     libraryPath = path.join(Directory.current.path, 'hello_library',
         'Debug', 'hello.dll');
   }
   ```

6. Open the dynamic library that contains the C function.

   ```dart
   final dylib = ffi.DynamicLibrary.open(libraryPath);
   ```

7. Get a reference to the C function,
   and put it into a variable.
   This code uses the `typedefs` from steps 2 and 3,
   along with the dynamic library variable from step 4.
   ```dart
   final HelloWorld hello = dylib
       .lookup<ffi.NativeFunction<hello_world_func>>('hello_world')
       .asFunction();
   ```

8. Call the C function.

   ```dart
   hello();
   ```

Once you understand the `hello_world` example,
consult the [other `dart:ffi` examples](#download-example-files).

## Bundle and load C libraries

The method to bundle / package / distribute then
load a native C library depends on the platform and library type.

To learn how, consult the following pages and examples.

* Flutter `dart:ffi` for [Android][android] apps
* Flutter `dart:ffi` for [iOS][ios] apps
* Flutter `dart:ffi` for [macOS][macos] apps
* [`dart:ffi` examples]({{samples}})

## Interface with native types

The `dart:ffi` library provides multiple types that implement [`NativeType`][]
and represent native types in C. You can instantiate some native types.
Some other native types can be used only as markers in type signatures.

### Can instantiate these type signature markers

The following native types can be used as markers in type signatures.
They or their subtypes _can_ be instantiated in Dart code.

{% capture dart-ffi -%}
{{site.dart-api}}/{{site.sdkInfo.channel}}/dart-ffi
{%- endcapture %}

| **Dart type**   | **Description**                                                  |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Array][]       | A fixed-sized array of items. Supertype of type specific arrays. |
| [Pointer][]     | Represents a pointer into native C memory.                       |
| [Struct][]      | The supertype of all FFI struct types.                           |
| [Union][]       | The supertype of all FFI union types.                            |

{:.table .table-striped }

### Serve as type signature markers only

The following list shows which platform-agnostic native types
that serve as markers in type signatures.
They _can't_ be instantiated in Dart code.

| [Uint16][]         | Represents a native unsigned 16 bit integer in C. |
| [Uint32][]         | Represents a native unsigned 32 bit integer in C. |
| [Uint64][]         | Represents a native unsigned 64 bit integer in C. |
| [Void][]           | Represents the `void` type in C.                  |

{:.table .table-striped }

There are also many [ABI][] specific marker native types
that extend [AbiSpecificInteger][].
To learn how these types map on specific platforms,
consult the API documentation linked in the following table.

| **Dart type**            | **Description**                                    |

## Generate FFI bindings with `package:ffigen`

For large API surfaces, it can be time-consuming
to write the Dart bindings that integrate with the C code.
To have Dart create FFI wrappers from C header files,
use the [`package:ffigen`][ffigen] binding generator.

## Build and bundle native assets {:#native-assets}

:::note
The native assets are **experimental**,
and [in active development]({{site.repo.dart.sdk}}/issues/50565).
:::

The _Native Assets_ feature should resolve a number of issues associated with
the distribution of Dart packages that depend on native code.
It does so by providing uniform hooks for integrating with various
build systems involved in building Flutter and standalone Dart applications.

This feature should simplify how Dart packages depend on and use native code.
Native Assets should provide the following benefits:

* Build the native code or obtains the binaries
  using a package's `hook/build.dart` build hook.
* Bundle the native [`Asset`][] that the `build.dart` build hook reports.
* Make native assets available at runtime through
  declarative `@Native<>() extern` functions using the [`assetId`][].

When you [opt in](#opt-in-to-the-experiment) to the native experiment,
The `flutter (run|build)` and `dart (run|build)` commands
build and bundle native code with the Dart code.

### Review the `native_add_library` example

The [`native_add_library`][] example includes the minimum code to
build and bundle C code in a Dart package.

The example includes the following files:

{% capture native-assets -%}
{{site.repo.dart.org}}/native/blob/main/pkgs/native_assets_cli/example/build/native_add_library
{%- endcapture %}

| **Source file**                         | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                |
------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [`src/native_add_library.c`][]          | The C file containing the code for `add`.                                                                                                                                      |
| [`lib/native_add_library.dart`][]       | The Dart file that invokes the C function `add` in asset `package:native_add_library/native_add_library.dart` through FFI. (Note that _asset id_ defaults to the library uri.) |
| [`test/native_add_library_test.dart`][] | A Dart test using the native code.                                                                                                                                             |
| [`hook/build.dart`][]                   | A build hook for compiling `src/native_add_library.c` and declaring the compiled asset with  id `package:native_add_library/native_add_library.dart`.                              |

{:.table .table-striped }

[`src/native_add_library.c`]: {{native-assets}}/src/native_add_library.c

[`test/native_add_library_test.dart`]: {{native-assets}}/test/native_add_library_test.dart
[`hook/build.dart`]: {{native-assets}}/hook/build.dart

When a Dart or Flutter project depends on `package:native_add_library`,
it invokes the `hook/build.dart` build hook on `run`, `build`, and `test` commands.
The [`native_add_app`][] example showcases a use of `native_add_library`.

### Review Native Asset API documentation

API documentation can be found for the following packages:

* To learn about native assets in Dart FFI,
  consult the `dart:ffi` API reference for [`Native`][] and [`DefaultAsset`][].
* To learn about the `hook/build.dart` build hook,
  consult the [`package:native_assets_cli` API reference][].
