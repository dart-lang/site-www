Seamlessly integrate JavaScript libraries and APIs into your Dart web app.

## Overview {: #overview }

The [Dart web platform][] provides powerful tools to
call JavaScript from Dart and vice-versa and allows you to leverage the vast
JavaScript ecosystem without leaving your Dart code.

This page provides a central hub for learning about JavaScript interoperability
in Dart. You'll find resources to get you started, detailed usage guides, and
information on the latest `dart:js_interop` library. Whether you're looking to
use a specific JavaScript library, or interact with browser APIs, this is the
place to start.

Get started wtih JS interop:

  * [How to mock JavaScript interop objects]

Review the reference guides:
  * [Usage reference]
  * [JS types reference]

Interact with the browser:
  * [`package:web` and migration]

## The evolution of JavaScript interop {: #next-generation-js-interop }

[Dart 3.3][] introduces a new generation of JS interop which offerins
a unified set of features and APIs to access JavaScript and browser
functionalities within your Dart code. This modern approach enhances the
developer experience and enables WebAssembly ([Wasm][]) support, aligning
Dart with the future of the web.

The following table maps Dart's new JS and web interop solutions to
their past counterparts:

| New interop libraries        | Previous libraries                       |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| [`package:web`][] | [`dart:html`][] <br> [`dart:indexed_db`][] <br> [`dart:svg`][] <br> [`dart:web_audio`][] <br> [`dart:web_gl`][] |
| [`dart:js_interop`][] <br> [`dart:js_interop_unsafe`][] | [`package:js`][] <br> [`dart:js`][] <br> [`dart:js_util`][] |
