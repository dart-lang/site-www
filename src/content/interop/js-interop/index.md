Seamlessly integrate JavaScript libraries and APIs into your Dart web app.

## Overview {: #overview }

The [Dart web platform][] provides powerful tools to
call JavaScript from Dart and vice-versa and allows you to leverage the vast
JavaScript ecosystem without leaving your Dart code.

This page provides a central hub for learning about JavaScript interoperability
in Dart. You'll find resources to get you started, detailed usage guides, and
information on the latest `dart:js_interop` library. Whether you're looking to
use a specific JavaScript library, or interact with browser APIs, this is the
place to start.
