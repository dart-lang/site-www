description: How to declare and use JS interop members.
---

JS interop provides the mechanisms to interact with JavaScript APIs from Dart.
It allows you to invoke these APIs and interact with the values that you get
from them using an explicit, idiomatic syntax.

Typically, you access a JavaScript API by making it available somewhere within
the [global JS scope]. To call and receive JS values from this API, you use
[`external` interop members](#interop-members). In order to construct and
provide types for JS values, you use and declare
[interop types](#interop-types), which also contain interop members. To pass
Dart values like `List`s or `Function` to interop members or convert from JS
values to Dart values, you use [conversion functions] unless the interop member
[contains a primitive type].

## Interop types

When interacting with a JS value, you need to provide a Dart type for it. You
can do this by either using or declaring an interop type. Interop types are
either a ["JS type"] provided by Dart or an [extension type] wrapping an interop
type.

Interop types allow you to provide an interface for a JS value and lets you
declare interop APIs for its members. They are also used in the signature of
other interop APIs.

```dart
extension type Window(JSObject _) implements JSObject {}
```

`Window` is an interop type for an arbitrary `JSObject`. There is no [runtime
guarantee][] that `Window` is actually a JS [`Window`]. There also is no conflict
with any other interop interface that is defined for the same value. If you want
to check that `Window` is actually a JS `Window`, you can
[check the type of the JS value through interop].

You can also declare your own interop type for the JS types Dart provides by
wrapping them:

```dart
extension type Array._(JSArray<JSAny?> _) implements JSArray<JSAny?> {
  external Array();
}
```

In most cases, you will likely declare an interop type using `JSObject` as the
[representation type] because you're likely interacting with JS objects which
don't have an interop type provided by Dart.

Interop types should also generally [implement] their representation type so
that they can be used where the representation type is expected, like in many
APIs in [`package:web`].

## Interop members

[`external`] interop members provide an idiomatic syntax for JS members. They
allow you to write a Dart type signature for its arguments and return value. The
types that can be written in the signature of these members have [restrictions].
The JS API the interop member corresponds to is determined by a combination of
where it's declared, its name, what kind of Dart member it is, and any
[renames](#js).

### Top-level interop members

Given the following JS members:

```js
globalThis.name = 'global';
globalThis.isNameEmpty = function() {
  return globalThis.name.length == 0;
}
```

You can write interop members for them like so:

```dart
@JS()
external String get name;

@JS()
external set name(String value);

@JS()
external bool isNameEmpty();
```

Here, there exists a property `name` and a function `isNameEmpty` that are
exposed in the global scope. To access them, you use top-level interop members.
To get and set `name`, you declare and use an interop getter and setter with the
same name. To use `isNameEmpty`, you declare and call an interop function with
the same name. You can declare top-level interop getters, setters, methods, and
fields. Interop fields are equivalent to getter and setter pairs.

Top-level interop members must be declared with a [`@JS()`](#js) annotation to
distinguish them from other `external` top-level members, like those that can be
written using `dart:ffi`.

### Interop type members

Given a JS interface like the following:

```js
class Time {
  constructor(hours, minutes) {
    this._hours = Math.abs(hours) % 24;
    this._minutes = arguments.length == 1 ? 0 : Math.abs(minutes) % 60;
  }

  static dinnerTime = new Time(18, 0);

  static getTimeDifference(t1, t2) {
    return new Time(t1.hours - t2.hours, t1.minutes - t2.minutes);
  }

  get hours() {
    return this._hours;
  }

  set hours(value) {
    this._hours = Math.abs(value) % 24;
  }

  get minutes() {
    return this._minutes;
  }

  set minutes(value) {
    this._minutes = Math.abs(value) % 60;
  }

  isDinnerTime() {
    return this.hours == Time.dinnerTime.hours && this.minutes == Time.dinnerTime.minutes;
  }
}
// Need to expose the type to the global scope.
globalThis.Time = Time;
```

You can write an interop interface for it like so:

```dart
extension type Time._(JSObject _) implements JSObject {
  external Time(int hours, int minutes);
  external factory Time.onlyHours(int hours);

  external static Time dinnerTime;
  external static Time getTimeDifference(Time t1, Time t2);

  external int hours;
  external int minutes;
  external bool isDinnerTime();

  bool isMidnight() => hours == 0 && minutes == 0;
}
```

Within an interop type, you can declare several different types of
`external` interop members:

- **Constructors**. When called, constructors with only positional parameters
  create a new JS object whose constructor is defined by the name of the
  extension type using `new`. For example, calling `Time(0, 0)` in Dart will
  generate a JS invocation that looks like `new Time(0, 0)`. Similarly, calling
  `Time.onlyHours(0)` will generate a JS invocation that looks like
  `new Time(0)`. Note that the JS invocations of the two constructors follow the
  same semantics, regardless of whether they're given a Dart name or if they are
  a factory.

  - **Object literal constructors**. It is useful sometimes to create a JS
    [object literal] that simply contains a number of properties and their
    values. In order to do this, you declare a constructor with only named
    parameters, where the names of the parameters will be the property names:

    ```dart
    extension type Options._(JSObject o) implements JSObject {
      external Options({int a, int b});
      external int get a;
      external int get b;
    }
    ```

    A call to `Options(a: 0, b: 1)` will result in creating the JS object
    `{a: 0, b: 1}`. The object is defined by the invocation arguments, so
    calling `Options(a: 0)` would result in `{a: 0}`. You can get or set the
    properties of the object through `external` instance members.

    :::warning
    Before Dart 3.3.1, object literal constructors required a
    [`@JS`](#js) annotation on the library to compile.
    To learn more, check out [`dart-lang/sdk#54801`][54801].
    :::

- **`static` members**. Like constructors, these members use the name of the
  extension type to generate the JS code. For example, calling
  `Time.getTimeDifference(t1, t2)` will generate a JS invocation that looks like
  `Time.getTimeDifference(t1, t2)`. Similarly, calling `Time.dinnerTime` will
  result in a JS invocation that looks like `Time.dinnerTime`. Like top-levels,
  you can declare `static` methods, getters, setters, and fields.

- **Instance members**. Like with other Dart types, these members require an
  instance in order to be used. These members get, set, or invoke properties on
  the instance. For example:

  ```dart
    final time = Time(0, 0);
    print(time.isDinnerTime()); // false
    final dinnerTime = Time.dinnerTime;
    time.hours = dinnerTime.hours;
    time.minutes = dinnerTime.minutes;
    print(time.isDinnerTime()); // true
  ```

  The call to `dinnerTime.hours` gets the value of the `hours` property of
  `dinnerTime`. Similarly, the call to `time.minutes=` sets the value of the
  `minutes` property of time. The call to `time.isDinnerTime()` calls the
  function in the `isDinnerTime` property of `time` and returns the value.
  Like top-levels and `static` members, you can declare instance methods,
  getters, setters, and fields.

- **Operators**. There are only two `external` interop operators allowed in
  interop types: `[]` and `[]=`. These are instance members that match the
  semantics of JS' [property accessors]. For example, you can declare them like:

  ```dart
  extension type Array(JSArray<JSNumber> _) implements JSArray<JSNumber> {
    external JSNumber operator [](int index);
    external void operator []=(int index, JSNumber value);
  }
  ```

  Calling `array[i]` gets the value in the `i`th slot of `array`, and
  `array[i] = i.toJS` sets the value in that slot to `i.toJS`. Other JS
  operators are exposed through [utility functions] in `dart:js_interop`.

Lastly, like any other extension type, you're allowed to declare any
[non-`external` members] in the interop type. `isMidnight` is one such example.

### Extension members on interop types

You can also write `external` members in [extensions] of interop types. For
example:

```dart
extension on Array {
  external int push(JSAny? any);
}
```

The semantics of calling `push` are identical to what it would have been if it
was in the definition of `Array` instead. Extensions can have `external`
instance members and operators, but cannot have `external` `static` members or
constructors. Like with interop types, you can write any non-`external` members
in the extension. These extensions are useful for when an interop type doesn't
expose the `external` member you need and you don't want to create a new interop
type.

### Parameters

`external` interop methods can only contain positional and optional arguments.
This is because JS members only take positional arguments. The one exception is
object literal constructors, where they can contain only named arguments.

Unlike with non-`external` methods, optional arguments do not get replaced with
their default value, but are instead omitted. For example:

```dart
external int push(JSAny? any, [JSAny? any2]);
```

Calling `array.push(0.toJS)` in Dart will result in a JS invocation of
`array.push(0.toJS)` and *not* `array.push(0.toJS, null)`. This allows users to
not have to write multiple interop members for the same JS API to avoid passing
in `null`s. If you declare a parameter with an explicit default value, you will
get a warning that the value will be ignored.

## `@JS()`

It is sometimes useful to refer to a JS property with a different name than the
one written. For example, if you want to write two `external` APIs that point to
the same JS property, you’d need to write a different name for at least one of
them. Similarly, if you want to define multiple interop types that refer to the
same JS interface, you need to rename at least one of them. Another example is
if the JS name cannot be written in Dart e.g. `$a`.

In order to do this, you can use the [`@JS()`] annotation with a constant
string value. For example:

```dart
extension type Array._(JSArray<JSAny?> _) implements JSArray<JSAny?> {
  external int push(JSNumber number);
  @JS('push')
  external int pushString(JSString string);
}
```

Calling either `push` or `pushString` will result in JS code that uses `push`.

You can also rename interop types:

```dart
@JS('Date')
extension type JSDate._(JSObject _) implements JSObject {
  external JSDate();

  external static int now();
}
```

Calling `JSDate()` will result in a JS invocation of `new Date()`. Similarly,
calling `JSDate.now()` will result in a JS invocation of `Date.now()`.

Furthermore, you can namespace an entire library, which will add a prefix to all
interop top-level members, interop types, and `static` interop members within
those types. This is useful if you want to avoid adding too many members to the
global JS scope.

```dart
@JS('library1')
library;

import 'dart:js_interop';

@JS()
external void method();

extension type JSType._(JSObject _) implements JSObject {
  external JSType();

  external static int get staticMember;
}
```

Calling `method()` will result in a JS invocation of `library1.method()`,
calling `JSType()` will result in a JS invocation of `new library1.JSType()`,
and calling `JSType.staticMember` will result in a JS invocation of
`library1.JSType.staticMember`.

Unlike interop members and interop types, Dart only ever adds a library name in
the JS invocation if you provide a non-empty value in the `@JS()` annotation on
the library. It does not use the Dart name of the library as the default.

```dart
library interop_library;

import 'dart:js_interop';

@JS()
external void method();
```

Calling `method()` will result in a JS invocation of `method()` and not
`interop_library.method()`.

You can also write multiple namespaces delimited by a `.` for libraries,
top-level members, and interop types:

```dart
@JS('library1.library2')
library;

import 'dart:js_interop';

@JS('library3.method')
external void method();

@JS('library3.JSType')
extension type JSType._(JSObject _) implements JSObject {
  external JSType();
}
```

Calling `method()` will result in a JS invocation of
`library1.library2.library3.method()`, calling `JSType()` will result in a JS
invocation of `new library1.library2.library3.JSType()`, and so forth.

You can't use `@JS()` annotations with `.` in the value on interop type members
or extension members of interop types, however.

If there is no value provided to `@JS()` or the value is empty, no renaming will
occur.

`@JS()` also tells the compiler that a member or type is intended to be treated
as a JS interop member or type. It is required (with or without a value) for all
top-level members to distinguish them from other `external` top-level members,
but can often be elided on and within interop types and on extension members as
the compiler can tell it is a JS interop type from the representation type and
on-type.

## `dart:js_interop` and `dart:js_interop_unsafe`

[`dart:js_interop`] contains all the necessary members you should need,
including `@JS`, JS types, conversion functions, and various utility functions.
Utility functions include:

- [`globalContext`], which represents the global scope that the compilers use to
  find interop members and types.
- [Helpers to inspect the type of JS values]
- JS operators
- [`dartify`] and [`jsify`], which check the type of certain JS values and
  convert them to Dart values and vice versa. Prefer using the specific
  conversion when you know the type of the JS value, as the extra type-checking
  may be expensive.
- [`importModule`], which allows you to import modules dynamically as
  `JSObject`s.

More utilities may be added to this library in the future.

[`dart:js_interop_unsafe`] contains members that allow you to look up properties
dynamically. For example:

```dart
JSFunction f = console['log'];
```

Instead of declaring an interop member named `log`, we're instead using a string
to represent the property. `dart:js_interop_unsafe` provides functionality to
dynamically get, set, and call properties.

:::tip
Avoid using `dart:js_interop_unsafe` if possible. It makes security compliance
more difficult to guarantee and may lead to violations, which is why it can be
"unsafe".
