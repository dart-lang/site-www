# Using Rust Code in Dart Programs

Integrating Rust with Dart enables high-performance native functionality in your Flutter applications. This guide introduces a popular package for Rust-Dart interoperability: [`flutter_rust_bridge`](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_rust_bridge).

## What is `flutter_rust_bridge`?

`flutter_rust_bridge` is a powerful package that simplifies communication between Dart and Rust. It allows you to use Rust's high-performance code seamlessly within your Dart or Flutter applications, without needing complex bindings or low-level FFI code.

## Why Use Rust with Dart?

- **Performance**: Rust is known for its speed and memory safety.
- **Concurrency**: Rust's built-in async features make it ideal for handling concurrent tasks.
- **Portability**: Rust compiles to various platforms, including those supported by Flutter.
- **Safety**: Rust's ownership system ensures memory-safe and bug-free programs.

Combining Rust's capabilities with Flutter's UI framework results in fast, reliable, and beautiful cross-platform apps.
