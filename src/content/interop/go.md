# Using Go Code in Dart Programs

Integrating Go with Dart can unlock powerful backend capabilities for your applications. This guide introduces a community-driven solution to help you achieve Go-Dart interoperability with ease.

## What is `flutter-go-bridge`?

[`flutter-go-bridge`](https://github.com/csnewman/flutter-go-bridge) is an open-source library designed to bridge the gap between Go and Dart. It provides tools to call Go functions directly from Dart, enabling seamless interaction between these two languages in your Flutter applications.

## Why Use Go with Dart?

- **High Performance**: Go is well-suited for building performance-critical components, such as networking or data processing.
- **Portability**: Go compiles to standalone binaries, making it easy to share across platforms.
- **Strong Ecosystem**: Go's ecosystem offers powerful libraries for tasks like concurrent programming, cryptography, and server-side development.

Combining Go's strengths with Dart's robust Flutter ecosystem can supercharge your app development workflow.
