This page lists the full history of changes to the Dart SDK and Dart language, organized by release. We use tags to classify changes, such as `New` for features, `Fixed` for bugs, and `Breaking` for incompatible changes.
Some changes are `Language versioned`, meaning they only take effect when you upgrade your code's language version.
