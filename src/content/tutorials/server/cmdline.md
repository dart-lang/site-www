:::secondary What's the point?
* Command-line applications need to do input and output.
* The `dart:io` library provides I/O functionality.
* The args package helps define and parse command-line arguments.
* A `Future` object represents a value that will be
  available at some time in the future.
* Streams provide a series of asynchronous data events.
* Most input and output requires the use of streams.
:::

:::note
This tutorial uses the `async` and `await` language features, which rely on
the [`Future`]({{_api}}/dart-async/Future-class.html) and
[`Stream`]({{_api}}/dart-async/Stream-class.html)
classes for asynchronous support.
To learn more about these features, see the
[asynchronous programming codelab](/codelabs/async-await) and the
[streams tutorial](/tutorials/language/streams).
:::

This tutorial teaches you how to build command-line apps
and shows you a few small command-line applications.
These programs use resources that most command-line applications need,
including the standard output, error, and input streams,
command-line arguments, files and directories, and more.

## Running an app with the standalone Dart VM

To run a command-line app in the Dart VM, use `dart run`.
The `dart` commands are included with the [Dart SDK](/tools/sdk).

:::important
The location of the SDK installation directory
(we'll call it `<sdk-install-dir>`) depends on your platform
and how you installed the SDK.
You can find `dart` in `<sdk-install-dir>/bin`.
By putting this directory in your PATH
you can refer to the `dart` command by name.
:::

Let's run a small program.

 1. Create a file called `hello_world.dart` that contains this code:

    <?code-excerpt "misc/test/samples_test.dart (hello-world)"?>
    ```dart
    void main() {
      print('Hello, World!');
    }
    ```

 2. In the directory that contains the file you just created, run the program:

    ```console
    $ dart run hello_world.dart
    Hello, World!
    ```

The Dart tool supports many commands and options.
Use `dart --help` to see commonly used commands and options.
Use `dart --verbose` to see all options.

## Overview of the dcat app code

This tutorial covers the details of a small sample app called `dcat`, which
displays the contents of any files listed on the command line.
This app uses various classes, functions, and properties
available to command-line apps.
Continue on in the tutorial to learn about each part of the app
and the various APIs used.

<?code-excerpt "cli/bin/dcat.dart (dcat-app)"?>
```dart
import 'dart:convert';
import 'dart:io';

import 'package:args/args.dart';

const lineNumber = 'line-number';

void main(List<String> arguments) {
  exitCode = 0; // Presume success
  final parser = ArgParser()..addFlag(lineNumber, negatable: false, abbr: 'n');

  ArgResults argResults = parser.parse(arguments);
  final paths = argResults.rest;

  dcat(paths, showLineNumbers: argResults[lineNumber] as bool);
}

Future<void> dcat(List<String> paths, {bool showLineNumbers = false}) async {
  if (paths.isEmpty) {
    // No files provided as arguments. Read from stdin and print each line.
    await stdin.pipe(stdout);
  } else {
    for (final path in paths) {
      var lineNumber = 1;
      final lines = utf8.decoder
          .bind(File(path).openRead())
          .transform(const LineSplitter());
      try {
        await for (final line in lines) {
          if (showLineNumbers) {
            stdout.write('${lineNumber++} ');
          }
          stdout.writeln(line);
        }
      } catch (_) {
        await _handleError(path);
      }
    }
  }
}

Future<void> _handleError(String path) async {
  if (await FileSystemEntity.isDirectory(path)) {
    stderr.writeln('error: $path is a directory');
  } else {
    exitCode = 2;
  }
}
```

### Getting dependencies

You might notice that dcat depends on a package named **args**.
To get the args package, use the
[pub package manager](/guides/packages).

A real app has tests, license files, dependency files, examples, and so on.
For the first app though, we can easily create only what is necessary
with the [`dart create`](/tools/dart-create) command.

1. Inside a directory, create the dcat app with the dart tool.
   
   ```console
   $ dart create dcat
   ```
   
2. Change to the created directory.

   ```console
   $ cd dcat
   ```
   
3. Inside the `dcat` directory, use [`dart pub add`](/tools/pub/cmd/pub-add) 
   to add the `args` package as a dependency.
   This adds `args` to the list of your dependencies
   found in the `pubspec.yaml` file.

   ```console
   $ dart pub add args
   ```

4. Open the `bin/dcat.dart` file and copy the preceding code into it.

:::note
To learn more about using packages and organizing your code, check out
[How to use packages](/guides/packages) and
[Package layout conventions](/tools/pub/package-layout).
:::

### Running dcat

Once you have your app's dependencies,
you can run the app from the command line over any text file,
like `pubspec.yaml`:

```console
$ dart run bin/dcat.dart -n pubspec.yaml
1 name: dcat
2 description: A sample command-line application.
3 version: 1.0.0
4 # repository: https://github.com/my_org/my_repo
5 
6 environment:
7   sdk: ^3.3.0
8 
9 # Add regular dependencies here.
10 dependencies:
11   args: ^2.4.2
12   # path: ^1.8.0
13 
14 dev_dependencies:
15   lints: ^3.0.0
16   test: ^1.24.0
```

This command displays each line of the specified file.
Because you specified the `-n` option,
a line number is displayed before each line.

## Parsing command-line arguments

The [args package]({{site.pub-pkg}}/args) provides
parser support for transforming command-line arguments
into a set of options, flags, and additional values.
Import the package's
[args library]({{argsAPI}}/args-library.html)
as follows:

<?code-excerpt "cli/bin/dcat.dart" retain="package:args"?>
```dart
import 'package:args/args.dart';
```

The `args` library contains these classes, among others:

| Class                                           | Description                                                     |
|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| [ArgParser]({{argsAPI}}/ArgParser-class.html)   | A command-line argument parser.                                 |
| [ArgResults]({{argsAPI}}/ArgResults-class.html) | The result of parsing command-line arguments using `ArgParser`. |

{: .table }

The following code in the `dcat` app uses these classes to
parse and store the specified command-line arguments:

<?code-excerpt "cli/bin/dcat.dart (arg-processing)" plaster="none" replace="/(ArgR.*|List[^\)]*|\..*|parser.*|argResults\S[^);]+)/[!$&!]/g"?>
```dart
void main([!List<String> arguments!]) {
  exitCode = 0; // Presume success
  final [!parser = ArgParser()..addFlag(lineNumber, negatable: false, abbr: 'n');!]

  [!ArgResults argResults = parser.parse(arguments);!]
  final paths = [!argResults.rest!];

  dcat(paths, showLineNumbers: [!argResults[lineNumber] as bool!]);
}
```

The Dart runtime passes command-line arguments to
the app's `main` function as a list of strings.
The `ArgParser` is configured to parse the `-n` option.
Then, the result of parsing command-line arguments is stored in `argResults`.

The following diagram shows how the `dcat` command line used above
is parsed into an `ArgResults` object.

![Run dcat from the command-line](/assets/img/tutorials/server/dcat-dart-run.svg){:width="350"}

You can access flags and options by name,
treating an `ArgResults` like a `Map`.
You can access other values using the `rest` property.

The [API reference]({{argsAPI}}/args-library.html)
for the `args` library provides detailed information to help you use
the `ArgParser` and `ArgResults` classes.

## Reading and writing with stdin, stdout, and stderr

Like other languages,
Dart has standard output, standard error, and standard input streams.
The standard I/O streams are defined at the top level of the `dart:io` library:

| Stream                          | Description         |
|---------------------------------|---------------------|
| [stdout]({{ioAPI}}/stdout.html) | The standard output |
| [stderr]({{ioAPI}}/stderr.html) | The standard error  |
| [stdin]({{ioAPI}}/stdin.html)   | The standard input  |

{: .table }

Import the `dart:io` library as follows:

<?code-excerpt "cli/bin/dcat.dart" retain="dart:io"?>
```dart
import 'dart:io';
```

:::note
Web apps (apps that depend on `dart:html`) can't use the `dart:io` library.
:::

### stdout

The following code from the `dcat` app
writes the line numbers to `stdout` (if the `-n` option is specified)
followed by the contents of the line from the file.

<?code-excerpt "cli/bin/dcat.dart (show-line-numbers)" replace="/stdout\..*/[!$&!]/g"?>
```dart
if (showLineNumbers) {
  [!stdout.write('${lineNumber++} ');!]
}
[!stdout.writeln(line);!]
```

The `write()` and `writeln()` methods take an object of any type,
convert it to a string, and print it.
The `writeln()` method also prints a newline character.
The `dcat` app uses the `write()` method to print the line number so
the line number and text appear on the same line.

You can also use the `writeAll()` method to print a list of objects,
or use `addStream()` to asynchronously print all the elements from a stream.

`stdout` provides more functionality than the `print()` function.
For example, you can display the contents of a stream with `stdout`.
However, you must use `print()` instead of `stdout`
for apps that run on the web.

### stderr

Use `stderr` to write error messages to the console.
The standard error stream has the same methods as `stdout`,
and you use it in the same way.
Although both `stdout` and `stderr` print to the console,
their output is separate and
can be redirected or piped in the command line
or programmatically to different destinations.

The following code from the `dcat` app prints an error message if
the user tries to output the lines of a directory instead of a file.

<?code-excerpt "cli/bin/dcat.dart (await-entity)" replace="/stderr\..*/[!$&!]/g"?>
```dart
if (await FileSystemEntity.isDirectory(path)) {
  [!stderr.writeln('error: $path is a directory');!]
} else {
  exitCode = 2;
}
```

### stdin

The standard input stream typically
reads data synchronously from the keyboard,
although it can read asynchronously
and get input piped in from the standard output of another program.

Here's a small program that reads a single line from `stdin`:

<?code-excerpt "cli/bin/dcat_stdin.dart"?>
```dart
import 'dart:io';

void main() {
  stdout.writeln('Type something');
  final input = stdin.readLineSync();
  stdout.writeln('You typed: $input');
}
```

The `readLineSync()` method reads text from the standard input stream,
blocking until the user types in text and presses return.
This little program prints out the typed text.

In the `dcat` app,
if the user does not provide a filename on the command line,
the program instead reads from stdin using the `pipe()` method.
Because `pipe()` is asynchronous
(returning a `Future`, even though this code doesn't use that return value),
the code that calls it uses `await`.

<?code-excerpt "cli/bin/dcat.dart (pipe)" replace="/pipe/[!$&!]/g"?>
```dart
await stdin.[!pipe!](stdout);
```

In this case, the user types in lines of text,
and the app copies them to stdout.
The user signals the end of input by pressing <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd>
(or <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd> on Windows).

```console
$ dart run bin/dcat.dart
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
```

## Getting info about a file

The [`FileSystemEntity`]({{ioAPI}}/FileSystemEntity-class.html)
class in the `dart:io` library provides properties and static methods
that help you inspect and manipulate the file system.

For example, if you have a path, you can
determine whether the path is a file, a directory, a link, or not found by
using the `type()` method from the `FileSystemEntity` class.
Because the `type()` method accesses the file system,
it performs the check asynchronously.

The following code from the `dcat` app uses `FileSystemEntity`
to determine if the path provided on the command line is a directory.
The returned `Future` completes with a boolean that
indicates if the path is a directory or not.
Because the check is asynchronous, the
code calls `isDirectory()` using `await`.

<?code-excerpt "cli/bin/dcat.dart (await-entity)" replace="/await.*path\)/[!$&!]/g"?>
```dart
if ([!await FileSystemEntity.isDirectory(path)!]) {
  stderr.writeln('error: $path is a directory');
} else {
  exitCode = 2;
}
```

Other interesting methods in the `FileSystemEntity` class
include `isFile()`, `exists()`, `stat()`, `delete()`, and `rename()`,
all of which also use a `Future` to return a value.

`FileSystemEntity` is the superclass for the
`File`, `Directory`, and `Link` classes.

## Reading a file

The `dcat` apps opens each file listed on the command line
with the `openRead()` method, which returns a `Stream`.
The `await for` block waits for the file to be read and decoded asynchronously.
When the data becomes available on the stream,
the app prints it to stdout.

<?code-excerpt "cli/bin/dcat.dart (for-path)" remove="/^\s*\/\/!tip.*/" replace="/(    )((await for| *stdout| *if| *}).*)/$1[!$2!]/g"?>
```dart
for (final path in paths) {
  var lineNumber = 1;
  final lines = utf8.decoder
      .bind(File(path).openRead())
      .transform(const LineSplitter());
  try {
    [!await for (final line in lines) {!]
    [!  if (showLineNumbers) {!]
    [!    stdout.write('${lineNumber++} ');!]
    [!  }!]
    [!  stdout.writeln(line);!]
    [!}!]
  } catch (_) {
    await _handleError(path);
  }
}
```

The following highlights the rest of the code, which uses two decoders that
transform the data before making it available in the `await for` block.
The UTF8 decoder converts the data into Dart strings.
`LineSplitter` splits the data at newlines.

<?code-excerpt "cli/bin/dcat.dart (for-path)" remove="/^\s*\/\/!tip.*/" replace="/utf8.decoder|LineSplitter()/[!$&!]/g"?>
```dart
for (final path in paths) {
  var lineNumber = 1;
  final lines = [!utf8.decoder!]
      .bind(File(path).openRead())
      .transform(const [!LineSplitter!]());
  try {
    await for (final line in lines) {
      if (showLineNumbers) {
        stdout.write('${lineNumber++} ');
      }
      stdout.writeln(line);
    }
  } catch (_) {
    await _handleError(path);
  }
}
```

The `dart:convert` library provides these and other data converters,
including one for JSON.
To use these converters you need to import the `dart:convert` library:

<?code-excerpt "cli/bin/dcat.dart" retain="dart:convert"?>
```dart
import 'dart:convert';
```

## Writing to a file

The easiest way to write text to a file is to create a
[`File`]({{ioAPI}}/File-class.html)
object and use the `writeAsString()` method:

<?code-excerpt "cli/lib/cmdline.dart (write-quote)"?>
```dart
final quotes = File('quotes.txt');
const stronger = 'That which does not kill us makes us stronger. -Nietzsche';

await quotes.writeAsString(stronger, mode: FileMode.append);
```

The `writeAsString()` method writes the data asynchronously.
It opens the file before writing and closes the file when done.
To append data to an existing file, you can use the optional
named parameter `mode` and set its value to `FileMode.append`.
Otherwise, the mode defaults to `FileMode.write` and
the previous contents of the file, if any, are overwritten.

If you want to write more data, you can open the file for writing.
The `openWrite()` method returns an `IOSink`,
which has the same type as stdin and stderr.
When using the `IOSink` returned from `openWrite()`,
you can continue to write to the file until done,
at which time, you must manually close the file.
The `close()` method is asynchronous and returns a `Future`.

<?code-excerpt "cli/lib/cmdline.dart (write-quotes)"?>
```dart
final quotes = File('quotes.txt').openWrite(mode: FileMode.append);

quotes.write("Don't cry because it's over, ");
quotes.writeln('smile because it happened. -Dr. Seuss');
await quotes.close();
```

## Getting environment information

{% assign PlatformAPI = ioAPI | append: '/Platform' -%}

Use the [`Platform`]({{PlatformAPI}}-class.html) class
to get information about the machine and operating system
that your app is running on.

The static [`Platform.environment`]({{PlatformAPI}}/environment.html) property
provides a copy of the environment variables in an immutable map.
If you need a mutable map (modifiable copy) you
can use `Map.of(Platform.environment)`.

<?code-excerpt "cli/lib/cmdline.dart (env)"?>
```dart
final envVarMap = Platform.environment;

print('PWD = ${envVarMap['PWD']}');
print('LOGNAME = ${envVarMap['LOGNAME']}');
print('PATH = ${envVarMap['PATH']}');
```

`Platform` provides other useful properties that give
information about the machine, OS, and currently
running app. For example:

- [`Platform.isMacOS()`]({{PlatformAPI}}/isMacOS.html)
- [`Platform.numberOfProcessors`]({{PlatformAPI}}/numberOfProcessors.html)
- [`Platform.script`]({{PlatformAPI}}/script.html)

## Setting exit codes

The `dart:io` library defines a top-level property,
`exitCode`, that you can change to set the exit code for
the current invocation of the Dart VM.
An exit code is a number passed from
a Dart app to the parent process
to indicate the success, failure, or other state of
the execution of the app.

The `dcat` app sets the exit code
in the `_handleError()` function to indicate that an error
occurred during execution.

<?code-excerpt "cli/bin/dcat.dart (handle-error)" remove="/^\s*\/\/!tip.*/" replace="/exit.*;/[!$&!]/g"?>
```dart
Future<void> _handleError(String path) async {
  if (await FileSystemEntity.isDirectory(path)) {
    stderr.writeln('error: $path is a directory');
  } else {
    [!exitCode = 2;!]
  }
}
```

An exit code of `2` indicates that the app encountered an error.

An alternative to using `exitCode` is to use the top-level `exit()` function,
which sets the exit code and exits the app immediately.
For example, the `_handleError()` function could call `exit(2)`
instead of setting `exitCode` to 2,
but `exit()` would quit the program and
it might not process all of the files specified by the running command.

:::note
Generally speaking, you're better off using the `exitCode` property,
which sets the exit code but allows the program to continue through to its
natural completion.
:::

Although you can use any number for an exit code,
by convention, the codes in the table below have the following meanings:

| Code | Meaning  |
|------|----------|
| 0    | Success  |
| 1    | Warnings |
| 2    | Errors   |
