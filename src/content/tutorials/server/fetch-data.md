:::secondary What you'll learn
* The basics of what HTTP requests and URIs are and what they are used for.
* Making HTTP requests using `package:http`.
* Decoding JSON strings into Dart objects with `dart:convert`.
* Converting JSON objects into class-based structures.
:::

Most applications require some form of communication or
data retrieval from the internet.
Many apps do so through HTTP requests,
which are sent from a client to a server
to perform a specific action for a resource
identified through a [URI][] (Uniform Resource Identifier).

Data communicated over HTTP can technically be in any form,
but using [JSON][] (JavaScript Object Notation)
is a popular choice due to its human-readability
and language independent nature.
The Dart SDK and ecosystem also have extensive support for JSON
with multiple options to best meet your app's requirements.

In this tutorial,
you will learn more about HTTP requests, URIs, and JSON.
Then you will learn how to use [`package:http`][http-pub]
as well as Dart's JSON support in the [`dart:convert`][convert-docs] library
to fetch, decode, then use JSON-formatted data
retrieved from an HTTP server.

## Background concepts

The following sections provide some extra background and information
around the technologies and concepts used in the tutorial
to facilitate fetching data from the server.

### JSON

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a data-interchange format
that has become ubiquitous across
application development and client-server communication.
It is lightweight but also easy for
humans to read and write due to being text based.
With JSON, various data types and simple data structures
such as lists and maps can be serialized and represented by strings.

Most languages have many implementations and
parsers have become extremely fast,
so you don't need to worry about interoperability or performance.
For more information about the JSON format, see [Introducing JSON][].
To learn more about working with JSON in Dart,
see the [Using JSON][] guide.

Two other packages exist with platform-specific implementations for mobile.

* [cronet_http]({{site.pub-pkg}}/cronet_http)
  provides access to the Android [Cronet][] HTTP client.
* [cupertino_http]({{site.pub-pkg}}/cupertino_http)
  provides access to Apple's [Foundation URL Loading System][furl].

To learn more about their capabilities,
consult the package documentation.

### HTTP requests

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a stateless protocol
designed for transmitting documents,
originally between web clients and web servers.
You interacted with the protocol to load this page,
as your browser uses an HTTP `GET` request
to retrieve the contents of a page from a web server.
Since its introduction, use of the HTTP protocol and its various versions
have expanded to applications outside the web as well,
essentially wherever communication from a client to a server is needed.

HTTP requests sent from the client to communicate with the server
are composed of multiple components.
HTTP libraries, such as `package:http`, allow you
to specify the following kinds of communication:

* An HTTP method defining the desired action,
  such as `GET` to retrieve data or `POST` to submit new data.
* The location of the resource through a URI.
* The version of HTTP being used.
* Headers that provide extra information to the server.
* An optional body, so the request can send data to the server,
  not just retrieve it.

To learn more about the HTTP protocol,
check out [An overview of HTTP][] on the mdn web docs.

[An overview of HTTP]: https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview

### URIs and URLs

To make an HTTP request,
you need to provide a [URI][] (Uniform Resource Identifier) to the resource.
A URI is a character string that uniquely identifies a resource.
A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is a specific kind of URI
that also provides the location of the resource.
URLs for resources on the web contain three pieces of information.
For this current page, the URL is composed of:

* The scheme used for determining the protocol used: `https`
* The authority or hostname of the server: `dart.dev`
* The path to the resource: `/tutorials/server/fetch-data.html`

There are other optional parameters as well
that aren't used by the current page:

* Parameters to customize extra behavior: `?key1=value1&key2=value2`
* An anchor, that isn't sent to the server,
  which points to a specific location in the resource: `#uris`

To learn more about URLs,
see [What is a URL?][] on the mdn web docs.

[What is a URL?]: https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_URL

## Retrieve the necessary dependencies

The `package:http` library provides a cross-platform solution
for making composable HTTP requests,
with optional fine-grained control.

:::note
You should avoid directly using `dart:io` or `dart:html`
to make HTTP requests.
Those libraries are platform-dependent
and tied to a single implementation.
:::

To add a dependency on `package:http`,
run the following [`dart pub add`][] command
from the top of your repo:

```console
$ dart pub add http
```

To use `package:http` in your code,
import it and optionally [specify a library prefix][]:

<?code-excerpt "lib/fetch_data.dart (http-import)"?>
```dart
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;
```

To learn more specifics about `package:http`,
see its [page on the pub.dev site][http-pub]
and its [API documentation][http-docs].

[`dart pub add`]: /tools/pub/cmd/pub-add
[specify a library prefix]: /language/libraries#specifying-a-library-prefix

## Build a URL

As previously mentioned,
to make an HTTP request,
you first need a URL that identifies
the resource being requested
or endpoint being accessed.

In Dart, URLs are represented through [`Uri`][] objects.
There are many ways to build an `Uri`,
but due to its flexibility,
parsing a string with `Uri.parse` to
create one is a common solution.

The following snippet shows two ways
to create a `Uri` object
pointing to mock JSON-formatted information
about `package:http` hosted on this site:

<?code-excerpt "lib/fetch_data.dart (build-uris)"?>
```dart
// Parse the entire URI, including the scheme
Uri.parse('https://dart.dev/f/packages/http.json');

// Specifically create a URI with the https scheme
Uri.https('dart.dev', '/f/packages/http.json');
```

To learn about other ways of building and interacting with URIs,
see the [`URI` documentation][].

[`Uri`]: {{site.dart-api}}/dart-core/Uri-class.html
[`URI` documentation]: /libraries/dart-core#uris

## Make a network request

If you just need to quickly fetch a string representation
of a requested resource,
you can use the top-level [`read`][http-read]
function found in `package:http`
that returns a `Future<String>` or throws
a [`ClientException`][http-client-exc] if the request wasn't successful.
The following example uses `read` to
retrieve the mock JSON-formatted information
about `package:http` as a string,
then prints it out:

:::note
Many functions in `package:http`, including `read`,
access the network and perform potentially time-consuming operations,
therefore they do so asynchronously and return a [`Future`][].
If you haven't encountered futures yet,
you can learn about them—as well as the `async` and `await` keywords—in the
[asynchronous programming codelab](/codelabs/async-await).
:::

<?code-excerpt "lib/fetch_data.dart (http-read)" replace="/readMain/main/g; /(http\.read)/[!$1!]/g"?>
```dart
void main() async {
  final httpPackageUrl = Uri.https('dart.dev', '/f/packages/http.json');
  final httpPackageInfo = await [!http.read!](httpPackageUrl);
  print(httpPackageInfo);
}
```

This results in the following JSON-formatted output,
which can also be seen in your browser at
[`/f/packages/http.json`][mock-http-json].

```json
{
  "name": "http",
  "latestVersion": "1.1.2",
  "description": "A composable, multi-platform, Future-based API for HTTP requests.",
  "publisher": "dart.dev",
  "repository": "https://github.com/dart-lang/http"
}
```  

Note the structure of the data
(in this case a map),
as you will need it when decoding the JSON later on.

If you need other information from the response,
such as the [status code][] or the [headers][],
you can instead use the top-level [`get`][http-get] function
that returns a `Future` with a [`Response`][http-response].

The following snippet uses `get` to get the whole response
in order to exit early if the request was not successful,
which is indicated with a status code of **200**:

<?code-excerpt "lib/fetch_data.dart (http-get)" replace="/getMain/main/g"?>
```dart
void main() async {
  final httpPackageUrl = Uri.https('dart.dev', '/f/packages/http.json');
  final httpPackageResponse = await http.get(httpPackageUrl);
  if (httpPackageResponse.statusCode != 200) {
    print('Failed to retrieve the http package!');
    return;
  }
  print(httpPackageResponse.body);
}
```

There are many other status codes besides **200**
and your app might want to handle them differently.
To learn more about what different status codes mean,
see [HTTP response status codes][] on the mdn web docs.

Some server requests require more information,
such as authentication or user-agent information;
in this case you might need to include [HTTP headers][headers].
You can specify headers by passing in a `Map<String, String>`
of the key-value pairs as the `headers` optional named parameter:

<?code-excerpt "lib/fetch_data.dart (http-headers)"?>
```dart
await http.get(Uri.https('dart.dev', '/f/packages/http.json'),
    headers: {'User-Agent': '<product name>/<product-version>'});
```

[http-response]: {{site.pub-api}}/http/latest/http/Response-class.html
[HTTP response status codes]: https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Status

### Make multiple requests

If you're making multiple requests to the same server,
you can instead keep a persistent connection
through a [`Client`][http-client],
which has similar methods to the top-level ones.
Just make sure to clean up with
the [`close`][http-close] method when done:

<?code-excerpt "lib/fetch_data.dart (http-client)" replace="/clientMain/main/g; /(http\.Cl.*?\))/[!$1!]/g; /(client\.c.*?\))/[!$1!]/g"?>
```dart
void main() async {
  final httpPackageUrl = Uri.https('dart.dev', '/f/packages/http.json');
  final client = [!http.Client()!];
  try {
    final httpPackageInfo = await client.read(httpPackageUrl);
    print(httpPackageInfo);
  } finally {
    [!client.close()!];
  }
}
```

To enable the client to retry failed requests,
import `package:http/retry.dart` and
wrap your created `Client` in a [`RetryClient`][http-retry-client]:

<?code-excerpt "lib/fetch_data.dart (http-retry)" plaster="none" replace="/retryMain/main/g; /(i.*?retry.*)/[!$1!]/g; /(Retry.*?\)\))/[!$1!]/g"?>
```dart
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;
[!import 'package:http/retry.dart';!]

void main() async {
  final httpPackageUrl = Uri.https('dart.dev', '/f/packages/http.json');
  final client = [!RetryClient(http.Client())!];
  try {
    final httpPackageInfo = await client.read(httpPackageUrl);
    print(httpPackageInfo);
  } finally {
    client.close();
  }
}
```

The `RetryClient` has a default behavior for how many
times to retry and how long to wait between each request,
but its behavior can be modified through parameters
to the [`RetryClient()`][http-retry-client-cons]
or [`RetryClient.withDelays()`][http-retry-client-delay] constructors.

`package:http` has much more functionality and customization,
so make sure to check out its [page on the pub.dev site][http-pub]
and its [API documentation][http-docs].

[http-client]: {{site.pub-api}}/http/latest/http/Client-class.html
[http-close]: {{site.pub-api}}/http/latest/http/Client/close.html
[http-retry-client]: {{site.pub-api}}/http/latest/retry/RetryClient-class.html
[http-retry-client-cons]: {{site.pub-api}}/http/latest/retry/RetryClient/RetryClient.html
[http-retry-client-delay]: {{site.pub-api}}/http/latest/retry/RetryClient/RetryClient.withDelays.html

## Decode the retrieved data

While you now have made a network request
and retrieved the returned data as string,
accessing specific portions of information
from a string can be a challenge.

Since the data is already in a JSON format,
you can use Dart's built-in [`json.decode`][decode-docs] function
in the `dart:convert` library
to convert the raw string into
a JSON representation using Dart objects.
In this case, the JSON data is represented in a map structure
and, in JSON, map keys are always strings,
so you can cast the result of `json.decode` to a `Map<String, dynamic>`:

<?code-excerpt "lib/fetch_data.dart (json-decode)" plaster="none" replace="/decodeMain/main/g; /(import 'd.*?;)/[!$1!]/g; /(json\.de.*?)\;/[!$1!];/g"?>
```dart
[!import 'dart:convert';!]

import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

void main() async {
  final httpPackageUrl = Uri.https('dart.dev', '/f/packages/http.json');
  final httpPackageInfo = await http.read(httpPackageUrl);
  final httpPackageJson = [!json.decode(httpPackageInfo) as Map<String, dynamic>!];
  print(httpPackageJson);
}
```

[decode-docs]: {{site.dart-api}}/{{site.sdkInfo.channel}}/dart-convert/JsonCodec/decode.html

### Create a structured class to store the data

To provide the decoded JSON with more structure,
making it easier to work with,
create a class that can store the
retrieved data using specific types depending
on the schema of your data.

The following snippet shows a class-based representation
that can store the package information returned
from the mock JSON file you requested.
This structure assumes all fields except the `repository`
are required and provided every time.

<?code-excerpt "bin/fetch_http_package.dart (package-info)" plaster="none"?>
```dart
class PackageInfo {
  final String name;
  final String latestVersion;
  final String description;
  final String publisher;
  final Uri? repository;

  PackageInfo({
    required this.name,
    required this.latestVersion,
    required this.description,
    required this.publisher,
    this.repository,
  });
}
```

### Encode the data into your class

Now that you have a class to store your data in,
you need to add a mechanism to convert
the decoded JSON into a `PackageInfo` object.

Convert the decoded JSON
by manually writing a `fromJson` method
matching the earlier JSON format,
casting types as necessary
and handling the optional `repository` field:

<?code-excerpt "bin/fetch_http_package.dart (from-json)"?>
```dart
class PackageInfo {
  // ···

  factory PackageInfo.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) {
    final repository = json['repository'] as String?;

    return PackageInfo(
      name: json['name'] as String,
      latestVersion: json['latestVersion'] as String,
      description: json['description'] as String,
      publisher: json['publisher'] as String,
      repository: repository != null ? Uri.tryParse(repository) : null,
    );
  }
}
```

A handwritten method, such as in the previous example,
is often sufficient for relatively simple JSON structures,
but there are more flexible options as well.
To learn more about JSON serialization and deserialization,
including automatic generation of the conversion logic,
see the [Using JSON][] guide.

### Convert the response to an object of your structured class

Now you have a class to store your data
and a way to convert the decoded JSON object
into an object of that type.
Next, you can write a function that
pulls everything together:

1. Create your `URI` based off a passed-in package name.
2. Use `http.get` to retrieve the data for that package.
3. If the request didn't succeed, throw an `Exception`
   or preferably your own custom `Exception` subclass.
4. If the request succeeded, use `json.decode` to
   decode the response body into a JSON string.
5. Converted the decoded JSON string into a `PackageInfo` object
   using the `PackageInfo.fromJson` factory constructor you created.

<?code-excerpt "bin/fetch_http_package.dart (get-package)" plaster="none"?>
```dart
Future<PackageInfo> getPackage(String packageName) async {
  final packageUrl = Uri.https('dart.dev', '/f/packages/$packageName.json');
  final packageResponse = await http.get(packageUrl);

  // If the request didn't succeed, throw an exception
  if (packageResponse.statusCode != 200) {
    throw PackageRetrievalException(
      packageName: packageName,
      statusCode: packageResponse.statusCode,
    );
  }

  final packageJson = json.decode(packageResponse.body) as Map<String, dynamic>;

  return PackageInfo.fromJson(packageJson);
}

class PackageRetrievalException implements Exception {
  final String packageName;
  final int? statusCode;

  PackageRetrievalException({required this.packageName, this.statusCode});
}
```

## Utilize the converted data

Now that you've retrieved data and
converted it to a more easily accessible format,
you can use it however you'd like.
Some possibilities include
outputting information to a CLI, or
displaying it in a [web][] or [Flutter][] app.

Here is complete, runnable example
that requests, decodes, then displays
the mock information about the `http` and `path` packages:

<?code-excerpt "bin/fetch_http_package.dart"?>
```dart:run-dartpad:height-600px:ga_id-fetch-data-complete
import 'dart:convert';

import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

void main() async {
  await printPackageInformation('http');
  print('');
  await printPackageInformation('path');
}

Future<void> printPackageInformation(String packageName) async {
  final PackageInfo packageInfo;

  try {
    packageInfo = await getPackage(packageName);
  } on PackageRetrievalException catch (e) {
    print(e);
    return;
  }

  print('Information about the $packageName package:');
  print('Latest version: ${packageInfo.latestVersion}');
  print('Description: ${packageInfo.description}');
  print('Publisher: ${packageInfo.publisher}');

  final repository = packageInfo.repository;
  if (repository != null) {
    print('Repository: $repository');
  }
}

Future<PackageInfo> getPackage(String packageName) async {
  final packageUrl = Uri.https('dart.dev', '/f/packages/$packageName.json');
  final packageResponse = await http.get(packageUrl);

  // If the request didn't succeed, throw an exception
  if (packageResponse.statusCode != 200) {
    throw PackageRetrievalException(
      packageName: packageName,
      statusCode: packageResponse.statusCode,
    );
  }

  final packageJson = json.decode(packageResponse.body) as Map<String, dynamic>;

  return PackageInfo.fromJson(packageJson);
}

class PackageInfo {
  final String name;
  final String latestVersion;
  final String description;
  final String publisher;
  final Uri? repository;

  PackageInfo({
    required this.name,
    required this.latestVersion,
    required this.description,
    required this.publisher,
    this.repository,
  });

  factory PackageInfo.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) {
    final repository = json['repository'] as String?;

    return PackageInfo(
      name: json['name'] as String,
      latestVersion: json['latestVersion'] as String,
      description: json['description'] as String,
      publisher: json['publisher'] as String,
      repository: repository != null ? Uri.tryParse(repository) : null,
    );
  }
}

class PackageRetrievalException implements Exception {
  final String packageName;
  final int? statusCode;

  PackageRetrievalException({required this.packageName, this.statusCode});

  @override
  String toString() {
    final buf = StringBuffer();
    buf.write('Failed to retrieve package:$packageName information');

    if (statusCode != null) {
      buf.write(' with a status code of $statusCode');
    }

    buf.write('!');
    return buf.toString();
  }
}
```

## What next?

Now that you have retrieved, parsed, and used
data from the internet,
consider learning more about [Concurrency in Dart][].
If your data is large and complex,
you can move retrieval and decoding
to another [isolate][] as a background worker
to prevent your interface from becoming unresponsive.
