title: Breaking changes and deprecations
description: A list of breaking changes by release in Dart.
---

This page lists all language and library breaking changes and deprecations in Dart,
organized by release and area, to help Dart users understand and manage their
impact. Complete release notes are available in the [Dart SDK changelog][changelog].
The [breaking change policy][] document describes the policy and process
around breaking changes and deprecations in Dart. 

**This page includes the following types of breaking changes**:

* **Unversioned**: The Dart SDK does not maintain backward compatibility, and
  code may break as soon as you [upgrade your sdk version][sdk] if it relies on
  the previous behavior.
  
  _These are the majority of changes and are not specially marked in this list._
* **Language versioned**: The Dart SDK maintains backward compatibility for
  existing code, and the behavior change only takes effect (potentially breaking
  code that relies on the previous behavior) when you upgrade the
  [language version][] of your code.
  
  
  _These are marked "**Language versioned**"_.
* **Deprecations**: The Dart SDK maintains compatibility for deprecated code,
  with a warning. Deprecations are then completely removed in a subsequent release,
  breaking any code that relies on the previous behavior.
  
  _These are marked "**Deprecated**" and "**Removed**", respectively_.
* **Experimental**: Part of the release but not yet treated as stable in the SDK,
  and can break from one version to another. Experimental changes do not
  always have a corresponding breaking change issue, but may have more detail in
  the [SDK changelog][changelog].

  _These are marked "**Experimental**", possibly in conjunction with another change type_.

If you have questions or concerns about any of these breaking changes, please 
comment on the breaking change issue linked from the relevant entry.

## 3.4.0

**Tentative**<br>
The following changes are expected to be included in the 3.4.0 stable release,
but the final list will likely change before then.
To reduce the potential impact of these changes, consider
accounting for them before the 3.4.0 release.

### Language {:.no_toc}

* [The pattern context type schema for cast patterns
  is now `_` (the unknown type) instead of `Object?`][54640].

### Tools {:.no_toc}

#### Production JavaScript compiler (dart2js)

  they were released in Dart 3 and are no longer necessary with
  a language version of 3.0 or greater.

  * `patterns`
  * `records`
  * `class-modifers`
  * `sealed-class`

### Language {:.no_toc}

* [An abstract getter is now considered promotable if

  on `Pointer` types are deprecated][54250].
  Migrate to the `-` and `+` operators instead.

  `@FfiNative` annotation has been removed. Usages should be
  updated to use the `@Native` annotation.

[54250]: https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/54250

#### `dart:html`

* Instead of using `HttpRequest` directly,
  it is now recommended to use [`package:http`][].

[`package:http`]: {{site.pub-pkg}}/http

#### `dart:io`

* Instead of using `HttpClient` directly,
  it is now recommended to use [`package:http`][].

[`package:http`]: {{site.pub-pkg}}/http

#### `dart:js_interop`

* **Experimental**: JS types like `JSAny` have
  [new compiler-specific representation types][52687].
* **Experimental**: User-defined `@staticInterop` classes can

#### `dart:typed_data`

* [The unmodifiable view classes for typed data will
  be deprecated in Dart 3.4][53128].

  the new `asUnmodifiableView` methods on typed data lists.

[53128]: https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/53218

#### `dart:nativewrappers`

* **Experimental**: [All native wrapper classes are now marked `base`][51896]

  `list_remove_unrelated_type` lints were removed.
  Consider migrating to the expanded
  [`collection_methods_unrelated_type`][] lint.
* The following lints are removed due to no longer being
  necessary with sound null safety. You should remove configuration of them
  from your `analysis_options.yaml` files and any ignore comments.
  
  * `always_require_non_null_named_parameters`
  * `avoid_returning_null`
  * `avoid_returning_null_for_future`

        print(_x?.abs()); // invalid_null_aware_operator
      }
      if (_x is int) {
        print((_x as int).bitLength); // unnecessary_cast
      }

## 3.1.0

### Libraries {:.no_toc}

#### `dart:async`

* [Added `interface` modifier to purely abstract classes:][52334]
 `MultiStreamController`, `StreamConsumer`, `StreamIterator` and `StreamTransformer`.

#### `dart:io`

* [Added `sameSite` to the `Cookie` class, and added the class `SameSite`][51486].
* [`FileSystemEvent` is `sealed`][52027]. This means `FileSystemEvent` cannot be

  no named members using `{}.jsify()`.

#### `package:js`

  longer be used as tear-offs. Declare a closure or a non-`external` method that
  calls these members, and use that instead.
* `external` `@staticInterop` members and `external` extension members will
  generate slightly different JS code for methods that have optional parameters.

  consistent with Dart2JS.

  been explicitly destroyed or upgraded to a secure socket upon setting or getting socket options.
* [The `Process` class now throws a `StateError`][40483]
  if the process is detached (`ProcessStartMode.detached` and
  `ProcessStartMode.detachedWithStdio`) upon accessing the `exitCode` getter.
* [The `Process` class now also throws][40483] when not connected to the child
  process's stdio (`ProcessStartMode.detached` and `ProcessStartMode.inheritStdio`) upon accessing the `stdin`, `stdout`, and `stderr` getters.
* The dummy object returned if `FileStat.stat()` or `FileStat.statSync()` fail
  [now contains Unix epoch timestamps][40706] instead of `null` for the `accessed`,

#### Dart Dev Compiler (DDC)

We fixed several inconsistencies between DDC and Dart2JS so that users less
frequently encounter code that is accepted by one compiler but then fails in the
other.

* Deleted the legacy (analyzer based) version of [DDC][ddc].
* Functions passed to JavaScript using the recommended `package:js` interop
  specification must now be wrapped with a call to `allowInterop`. 
* Constructors in `@JS()` classes must be marked with `external`.

#### `dart2js`

* Corresponding type parameter bounds now only need to be mutual
  subtypes rather than structurally equal up to renaming of bound type variables
  and equating all top types.
* Types are now [normalized].
* Constructors in `@JS()` classes must be marked with `external`.
* Completely removed the `--package-root` flag, which was hidden and disabled
  in Dart 2.0.0.
