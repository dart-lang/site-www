This page covers a collection of books about the Dart language.
Many [Flutter books](https://flutter.dev/docs/resources/books)
also cover Dart.
If you find another Dart book that might be helpful,
[let us know.](https://github.com/dart-lang/site-www/issues)

:::warning
If you find a Dart book not listed on this page,
check for publication dates after June 2021.
Older books lack coverage of Dart 2 and 3 topics such as
strong typing, null safety, FFI, the `dart` command-line utility,
and new developer tools.
