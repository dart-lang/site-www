Welcome to the Dart tutorial!
This tutorial teaches you how to write Dart code by building an
interactive command-line (CLI) application.

You'll start from the very beginning: creating a blank Dart application.
By the end, you'll have built an app that demonstrates the essential
features of Dart development—variables, functions, classes,
async programming, testing, and more!

### Before you begin {:.no_toc}

**Part of the Flutter learning pathway**

This tutorial is the second step in the
[Dart and Flutter learning pathway]({{site.flutter-docs}}/learn/pathway).
If you're interested in learning both Dart and Flutter,
start there!
:::

This tutorial assumes that you have:

1. A Dart environment set up—if not,
   follow the instructions to [get the Dart SDK](/get-dart).
2. Basic familiarity with programming concepts. The tutorial 
   is beginner friendly, but doesn't cover the fundamentals of programming.
