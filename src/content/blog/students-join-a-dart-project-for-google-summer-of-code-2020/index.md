[Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) (*GSoC*) is a global program focused on bringing student developers into open source software development. Students are sponsored by Google to work with a mentoring open source organization on a 3-month programming project during the summer. Over the past 15 years more than 15,000 students have participated in Google Summer of Code.

This year we’re thrilled to announce that [Dart is a mentoring organization](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/6544944065413120/) in Google Summer of Code 2020.
