The Google Summer of Code (GSoC) program focuses on bringing student developers from around the world into open source software development. Google sponsors students to work with a mentoring open source organization on a 12 week (or longer) programming project during the summer. Over the past 19 years, more than 20,000 contributors have participated in Google Summer of Code.

We’re excited to announce that the Dart project will mentor contributors (for the fifth time!) in Google Summer of Code 2024.

### **Are you interested?**

To get started now, read [the list of project ideas](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/wiki/Dart-GSoC-2024-Project-Ideas) to find a match for your skills and interests. Formal applications must be submitted before April 2. We encourage prospective applicants to submit early drafts and ask for feedback.
> *The Dart team expects to have enough mentors to accept only a handful of applications, so also check out [the other mentoring organizations](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2024/organizations).*

If you have questions specific to Dart and GSoC, ask them on [our dedicated mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/dart-gsoc).
