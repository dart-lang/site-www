The [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) (GSoC) program focuses on bringing student developers from around the world into open source software development. Google sponsors students to work with a mentoring open source organization on a 12 week (or longer) programming project during the summer. Over the past 20 years, more than 21,000 contributors have participated in Google Summer of Code.

**Are you interested?**

To get started now, read [the list of project ideas](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/blob/main/docs/gsoc/Dart-GSoC-2025-Project-Ideas.md) to find a match for your skills and interests. Formal applications must be submitted before April 8th. We encourage prospective applicants to submit early drafts and ask for feedback.
> *The Dart team expects to have enough mentors to accept only a handful of applications, so also check out [the other mentoring organizations](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2024/organizations).*

If you have questions specific to Dart and GSoC, ask them on [our dedicated mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/dart-gsoc).
