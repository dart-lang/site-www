Dart libraries are full of functions that
return [`Future`][] or [`Stream`][] objects.
These functions are _asynchronous_:
they return after setting up
a possibly time-consuming operation
(such as I/O),
without waiting for that operation to complete.

The `async` and `await` keywords support asynchronous programming,
letting you write asynchronous code that
looks similar to synchronous code.


## Handling Futures

When you need the result of a completed Future,
you have two options:

* Use `async` and `await`, as described here and in the
  [asynchronous programming codelab](/codelabs/async-await).
* Use the Future API, as described in the
  [`dart:async` documentation](/libraries/dart-async#future).

Code that uses `async` and `await` is asynchronous,
but it looks a lot like synchronous code.
For example, here's some code that uses `await`
to wait for the result of an asynchronous function:

<?code-excerpt "misc/lib/language_tour/async.dart (await-look-up-version)"?>
```dart
await lookUpVersion();
```

To use `await`, code must be in an `async` function—a
function marked as `async`:

<?code-excerpt "misc/lib/language_tour/async.dart (checkVersion)" replace="/async|await/[!$&!]/g"?>
```dart
Future<void> checkVersion() [!async!] {
  var version = [!await!] lookUpVersion();
  // Do something with version
}
```

:::note
Although an `async` function might perform time-consuming operations, 
it doesn't wait for those operations. 
Instead, the `async` function executes only
until it encounters its first `await` expression.
Then it returns a `Future` object,
resuming execution only after the `await` expression completes.
:::

Use `try`, `catch`, and `finally` to handle errors and cleanup
in code that uses `await`:

<?code-excerpt "misc/lib/language_tour/async.dart (try-catch)"?>
```dart
try {
  version = await lookUpVersion();
} catch (e) {
  // React to inability to look up the version
}
```

You can use `await` multiple times in an `async` function.
For example, the following code waits three times
for the results of functions:

<?code-excerpt "misc/lib/language_tour/async.dart (repeated-await)"?>
```dart
var entrypoint = await findEntryPoint();
var exitCode = await runExecutable(entrypoint, args);
await flushThenExit(exitCode);
```

In <code>await <em>expression</em></code>,
the value of <code><em>expression</em></code> is usually a Future;
if it isn't, then the value is automatically wrapped in a Future.
This Future object indicates a promise to return an object.
The value of <code>await <em>expression</em></code> is that returned object.
The await expression makes execution pause until that object is available.

**If you get a compile-time error when using `await`,
make sure `await` is in an `async` function.**
For example, to use `await` in your app's `main()` function,
the body of `main()` must be marked as `async`:

<?code-excerpt "misc/lib/language_tour/async.dart (main)" replace="/async|await/[!$&!]/g"?>
```dart
void main() [!async!] {
  checkVersion();
  print('In main: version is ${[!await!] lookUpVersion()}');
}
```

:::note
The preceding example uses an `async` function (`checkVersion()`)
without waiting for a result—a practice that can cause problems
if the code assumes that the function has finished executing.
To avoid this problem,
use the [unawaited_futures linter rule][].

see the [asynchronous programming codelab](/codelabs/async-await).


## Declaring async functions

An `async` function is a function whose body is marked with
the `async` modifier.

Adding the `async` keyword to a function makes it return a Future.
For example, consider this synchronous function,
which returns a String:

<?code-excerpt "misc/lib/language_tour/async.dart (sync-look-up-version)"?>
```dart
String lookUpVersion() => '1.0.0';
```

If you change it to be an `async` function—for example,
because a future implementation will be time consuming—the
returned value is a Future:

<?code-excerpt "misc/lib/language_tour/async.dart (async-look-up-version)"?>
```dart
Future<String> lookUpVersion() async => '1.0.0';
```

Note that the function's body doesn't need to use the Future API.
Dart creates the Future object if necessary.
If your function doesn't return a useful value,
make its return type `Future<void>`.

see the [asynchronous programming codelab](/codelabs/async-await).

## Handling Streams

When you need to get values from a Stream,
you have two options:

* Use `async` and an _asynchronous for loop_ (`await for`).
* Use the Stream API, as described in the
  [`dart:async` documentation](/libraries/dart-async#stream).

:::note
Before using `await for`, be sure that it makes the code clearer and that you
really do want to wait for all of the stream's results. For example, you
usually should **not** use `await for` for UI event listeners, because UI
frameworks send endless streams of events.
:::

An asynchronous for loop has the following form:

<?code-excerpt "misc/lib/language_tour/async.dart (await-for)"?>
```dart
await for (varOrType identifier in expression) {
  // Executes each time the stream emits a value.
}
```

The value of <code><em>expression</em></code> must have type Stream.
Execution proceeds as follows:

1. Wait until the stream emits a value.
2. Execute the body of the for loop,
   with the variable set to that emitted value.
3. Repeat 1 and 2 until the stream is closed.

To stop listening to the stream,
you can use a `break` or `return` statement,
which breaks out of the for loop
and unsubscribes from the stream.

**If you get a compile-time error when implementing an asynchronous for loop,
make sure the `await for` is in an `async` function.**
For example, to use an asynchronous for loop in your app's `main()` function,
the body of `main()` must be marked as `async`:

<?code-excerpt "misc/lib/language_tour/async.dart (number-thinker)" replace="/async|await for/[!$&!]/g"?>
```dart
void main() [!async!] {
  // ...
  [!await for!] (final request in requestServer) {
    handleRequest(request);
  }
  // ...
}
```
