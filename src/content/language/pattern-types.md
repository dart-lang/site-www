This page is a reference for the different kinds of patterns.
For an overview of how patterns work, where you can use them in Dart, and common
use cases, visit the main [Patterns][] page.

#### Pattern precedence

Similar to [operator precedence](/language/operators#operator-precedence-example),
pattern evaluation adheres to precedence rules.
You can use [parenthesized patterns](#parenthesized) to 
evaluate lower-precedence patterns first.  

This document lists the pattern types in ascending order of precedence:

* [Logical-or](#logical-or) patterns are lower-precedence than [logical-and](#logical-and),
logical-and patterns are lower-precedence than [relational](#relational) patterns,
and so on. 

* Post-fix unary patterns ([cast](#cast), [null-check](#null-check),
and [null-assert](#null-assert)) share the same level of precedence. 

* The remaining primary patterns share the highest precedence.
Collection-type ([record](#record), [list](#list), and [map](#map))
and [Object](#object) patterns encompass other
data, so are evaluated first as outer-patterns. 

## Logical-or

`subpattern1 || subpattern2`

A logical-or pattern separates subpatterns by `||` and matches if any of the
branches match. Branches are evaluated left-to-right. Once a branch matches, the
rest are not evaluated.

<?code-excerpt "language/lib/patterns/pattern_types.dart (logical-or)"?>
```dart
var isPrimary = switch (color) {
  Color.red || Color.yellow || Color.blue => true,
  _ => false
};
```

Subpatterns in a logical-or pattern can bind variables, but the branches must
define the same set of variables, because only one branch will be evaluated when
the pattern matches.

## Logical-and	

`subpattern1 && subpattern2`

A pair of patterns separated by `&&` matches only if both subpatterns match. If the
left branch does not match, the right branch is not evaluated.

Subpatterns in a logical-and pattern can bind variables, but the variables in
each subpattern must not overlap, because they will both be bound if the pattern
matches:

<?code-excerpt "language/lib/patterns/pattern_types.dart (logical-and)"?>
```dart
switch ((1, 2)) {
  // Error, both subpatterns attempt to bind 'b'.
  case (var a, var b) && (var b, var c): // ...
}
```

## Relational

`== expression`

`< expression`

Relational patterns compare the matched value to a given constant using any of
the equality or relational operators: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, and `>=`.

The pattern matches when calling the appropriate operator on the matched value
with the constant as an argument returns `true`.

Relational patterns are useful for matching on numeric ranges, especially when
combined with the [logical-and pattern](#logical-and):

<?code-excerpt "language/lib/patterns/pattern_types.dart (relational)"?>
```dart
String asciiCharType(int char) {
  const space = 32;
  const zero = 48;
  const nine = 57;

  return switch (char) {
    < space => 'control',
    == space => 'space',
    > space && < zero => 'punctuation',
    >= zero && <= nine => 'digit',
    _ => ''
  };
}
```

## Cast

`foo as String`

A cast pattern lets you insert a [type cast][] in the middle of destructuring,
before passing the value to another subpattern:

<?code-excerpt "language/lib/patterns/pattern_types.dart (cast)"?>
```dart
(num, Object) record = (1, 's');
var (i as int, s as String) = record;
```

Cast patterns will [throw][] if the value doesn't have the stated type.
Like the [null-assert pattern](#null-assert), this lets you forcibly assert the
expected type of some destructured value.

## Null-check	

`subpattern?`

Null-check patterns match first if the value is not null, and then match the inner
pattern against that same value. They let you bind a variable whose type is the
non-nullable base type of the nullable value being matched.

To treat `null` values as match failures
without throwing, use the null-check pattern.

<?code-excerpt "language/lib/patterns/pattern_types.dart (null-check)"?>
```dart
String? maybeString = 'nullable with base type String';
switch (maybeString) {
  case var s?:
  // 's' has type non-nullable String here.
}
```

To match when the value _is_ null, use the [constant pattern](#constant) `null`.

## Null-assert	

`subpattern!`

Null-assert patterns match first if the object is not null, then on the value.
They permit non-null values to flow through, but [throw][] if the matched value
is null. 

To ensure `null` values are not silently treated as match failures,
use a null-assert pattern while matching:

<?code-excerpt "language/lib/patterns/pattern_types.dart (null-assert-match)"?>
```dart
List<String?> row = ['user', null];
switch (row) {
  case ['user', var name!]: // ...
  // 'name' is a non-nullable string here.
}
```

To eliminate `null` values from variable declaration patterns,
use the null-assert pattern:

<?code-excerpt "language/lib/patterns/pattern_types.dart (null-assert-dec)"?>
```dart
(int?, int?) position = (2, 3);

var (x!, y!) = position;
```

To match when the value _is_ null, use the [constant pattern](#constant) `null`.

## Constant	

`123, null, 'string', math.pi, SomeClass.constant, const Thing(1, 2), const (1 + 2)`

Constant patterns match when the value is equal to the constant: 

<?code-excerpt "language/lib/patterns/pattern_types.dart (constant)"?>
```dart
switch (number) {
  // Matches if 1 == number.
  case 1: // ...
}
```

You can use simple literals and references to named constants directly as constant patterns:

- Number literals (`123`, `45.56`)
- Boolean literals (`true`)
- String literals (`'string'`)
- Named constants (`someConstant`, `math.pi`, `double.infinity`)
- Constant constructors (`const Point(0, 0)`)
- Constant collection literals (`const []`, `const {1, 2}`)

More complex constant expressions must be parenthesized and prefixed with
`const` (`const (1 + 2)`):

<?code-excerpt "language/lib/patterns/pattern_types.dart (complex-constant)"?>
```dart
// List or map pattern:
case [a, b]: // ...

// List or map literal:
case const [a, b]: // ...
```

## Variable

`var bar, String str, final int _`

Variable patterns bind new variables to values that have been matched or destructured. 
They usually occur as part of a [destructuring pattern][destructure] to
capture a destructured value.

The variables are in scope in a region of code that is only reachable when the
pattern has matched.

<?code-excerpt "language/lib/patterns/pattern_types.dart (variable)"?>
```dart
switch ((1, 2)) {
  // 'var a' and 'var b' are variable patterns that bind to 1 and 2, respectively.
  case (var a, var b): // ...
  // 'a' and 'b' are in scope in the case body.
}
```

A _typed_ variable pattern only matches if the matched value has the declared type,
and fails otherwise:

<?code-excerpt "language/lib/patterns/pattern_types.dart (variable-typed)"?>
```dart
switch ((1, 2)) {
  // Does not match.
  case (int a, String b): // ...
}
```

You can use a [wildcard pattern](#wildcard) as a variable pattern. 

## Identifier	

`foo, _`

Identifier patterns may behave like a [constant pattern](#constant) or like a
[variable pattern](#variable), depending on the context where they appear:

- [Declaration][] context: declares a new variable with identifier name:
  `var (a, b) = (1, 2);`
- [Assignment][] context: assigns to existing variable with identifier name:
  `(a, b) = (3, 4);`
- [Matching][] context: treated as a named constant pattern (unless its name is `_`):
  <?code-excerpt "language/lib/patterns/pattern_types.dart (match-context)"?>
  ```dart
  const c = 1;
  switch (2) {
    case c:
      print('match $c');
    default:
      print('no match'); // Prints "no match".
  }
  ``` 
- [Wildcard](#wildcard) identifier in any context: matches any value and discards it:
  `case [_, var y, _]: print('The middle element is $y');`

## Parenthesized

`(subpattern)`

Like parenthesized expressions, parentheses in a pattern let you control
[pattern precedence](#pattern-precedence) and insert a lower-precedence
pattern where a higher precedence one is expected.

For example, imagine the boolean constants `x`, `y`, and `z`
equal `true`, `true`, and `false`, respectively.
Though the following example resembles boolean expression evaulation,
the example matches patterns.

<?code-excerpt "language/lib/patterns/pattern_types.dart (parens)"?>
```dart
// ...
x || y => 'matches true',
x || y && z => 'matches true',
x || (y && z) => 'matches true',
// `x || y && z` is the same thing as `x || (y && z)`.
(x || y) && z => 'matches nothing',
// ...
```

Dart starts matching the pattern from left to right.

1. The first pattern matches `true` as `x` matches `true`.
1. The second pattern matches `true` as `x` matches `true`.
1. The third pattern matches `true` as `x` matches `true`.
1. The fourth pattern `(x || y) && z` has no match.

   * The `x` matches `true`, so Dart doesn't try to match `y`.
   * Though `(x || y)` matches `true`, `z` doesn't match `true`
   * Therefore, pattern `(x || y) && z` doesn't match `true`.
   * The subpattern `(x || y)` doesn't match `false`,
     so Dart doesn't try to match `z`.
   * Therefore, pattern `(x || y) && z` doesn't match `false`.
   * As a conclusion, `(x || y) && z` has no match.

## List

`[subpattern1, subpattern2]`

A list pattern matches values that implement [`List`][], and then recursively
matches its subpatterns against the list's elements to destructure them by position:

<?code-excerpt "language/lib/patterns/switch.dart (list-pattern)"?>
```dart
const a = 'a';
const b = 'b';
switch (obj) {
  // List pattern [a, b] matches obj first if obj is a list with two fields,
  // then if its fields match the constant subpatterns 'a' and 'b'.
  case [a, b]:
    print('$a, $b');
}
```  

List patterns require that the number of elements in the pattern match the entire
list. You can, however, use a [rest element](#rest-element) as a place holder to
account for any number of elements in a list. 

### Rest element

List patterns can contain _one_ rest element (`...`) which allows matching lists
of arbitrary lengths.

<?code-excerpt "language/lib/patterns/pattern_types.dart (rest)"?>
```dart
var [a, b, ..., c, d] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7];
// Prints "1 2 6 7".
print('$a $b $c $d');
```

A rest element can also have a subpattern that collects elements that don't match
the other subpatterns in the list, into a new list:

<?code-excerpt "language/lib/patterns/pattern_types.dart (rest-sub)"?>
```dart
var [a, b, ...rest, c, d] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7];
// Prints "1 2 [3, 4, 5] 6 7".
print('$a $b $rest $c $d');
```

## Map

`{"key": subpattern1, someConst: subpattern2}`

Map patterns match values that implement [`Map`][], and then recursively 
match its subpatterns against the map's keys to destructure them.

Map patterns don't require the pattern to match the entire map. A map pattern
ignores any keys that the map contains that aren't matched by the pattern.

## Record

`(subpattern1, subpattern2)`

`(x: subpattern1, y: subpattern2)`

Record patterns match a [record][] object and destructure its fields.
If the value isn't a record with the same [shape][] as the pattern, the match
fails. Otherwise, the field subpatterns are matched against the corresponding
fields in the record.

Record patterns require that the pattern match the entire record. To destructure 
a record with _named_ fields using a pattern, include the field names in the pattern:

<?code-excerpt "language/lib/patterns/pattern_types.dart (record)"?>
```dart
var (myString: foo, myNumber: bar) = (myString: 'string', myNumber: 1);
```

The getter name can be omitted and inferred from the [variable pattern](#variable)
or [identifier pattern](#identifier) in the field subpattern. These pairs of
patterns are each equivalent:

<?code-excerpt "language/lib/patterns/pattern_types.dart (record-getter)"?>
```dart
// Record pattern with variable subpatterns:
var (untyped: untyped, typed: int typed) = record;
var (:untyped, :int typed) = record;

switch (record) {
  case (untyped: var untyped, typed: int typed): // ...
  case (:var untyped, :int typed): // ...
}

// Record pattern with null-check and null-assert subpatterns:
switch (record) {
  case (checked: var checked?, asserted: var asserted!): // ...
  case (:var checked?, :var asserted!): // ...
}

// Record pattern with cast subpattern:
var (untyped: untyped as int, typed: typed as String) = record;
var (:untyped as int, :typed as String) = record;
```

## Object

`SomeClass(x: subpattern1, y: subpattern2)`

Object patterns check the matched value against a given named type to destructure
data using getters on the object's properties. They are [refuted][]
if the value doesn't have the same type.

<?code-excerpt "language/lib/patterns/pattern_types.dart (object)"?>
```dart
switch (shape) {
  // Matches if shape is of type Rect, and then against the properties of Rect.
  case Rect(width: var w, height: var h): // ...
}
```  

The getter name can be omitted and inferred from the [variable pattern](#variable)
or [identifier pattern](#identifier) in the field subpattern:

<?code-excerpt "language/lib/patterns/pattern_types.dart (object-getter)"?>
```dart
// Binds new variables x and y to the values of Point's x and y properties.
var Point(:x, :y) = Point(1, 2);
```

Object patterns don't require the pattern to match the entire object.
If an object has extra fields that the pattern doesn't destructure, it can still match.

## Wildcard

`_`

A pattern named `_` is a wildcard, either a [variable pattern](#variable) or
[identifier pattern](#identifier), that doesn't bind or assign to any variable.

It's useful as a placeholder in places where you need a subpattern in order to
destructure later positional values:

<?code-excerpt "language/lib/patterns/pattern_types.dart (wildcard)"?>
```dart
var list = [1, 2, 3];
var [_, two, _] = list;
```

A wildcard name with a type annotation is useful when you want to test a value's
type but not bind the value to a name:

<?code-excerpt "language/lib/patterns/pattern_types.dart (wildcard-typed)"?>
```dart
switch (record) {
  case (int _, String _):
    print('First field is int and second is String.');
}
```
