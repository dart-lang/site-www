To allow an instance of your Dart class to be called like a function,
implement the `call()` method.

The `call()` method allows an instance of any class that defines it to emulate a function.
This method supports the same functionality as normal [functions][]
such as parameters and return types.

In the following example, the `WannabeFunction` class defines a `call()` function
that takes three strings and concatenates them, separating each with a space,
and appending an exclamation. Click **Run** to execute the code.

<?code-excerpt "misc/lib/language_tour/callable_objects.dart"?>
```dart:run-dartpad:height-350px:ga_id-callable_objects
class WannabeFunction {
  String call(String a, String b, String c) => '$a $b $c!';
}

var wf = WannabeFunction();
var out = wf('Hi', 'there,', 'gang');

void main() => print(out);
```
