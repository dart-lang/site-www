Dart has built-in support for list, set, and map [collections][].
To learn more about configuring the types collections contain,
check out [Generics][].

[collections]: /libraries/dart-core#collections

## Lists

Perhaps the most common collection in nearly every programming language
is the *array*, or ordered group of objects. In Dart, arrays are
[`List`][] objects, so most people just call them *lists*.

Dart list literals are denoted by a comma-separated list of
elements enclosed in square brackets (`[]`). Each element
is usually an expression. Here's a simple Dart list:

<?code-excerpt "misc/lib/language_tour/built_in_types.dart (list-literal)"?>
```dart
var list = [1, 2, 3];
```

:::note
Dart infers that `list` has type `List<int>`. If you try to add non-integer
objects to this list, the analyzer or runtime raises an error. For more
information, read about [type inference][].
:::

<a id="trailing-comma"></a>
You can add a comma after the last item in a Dart collection literal.
This _trailing comma_ doesn't affect the collection,
but it can help prevent copy-paste errors.

<?code-excerpt "misc/lib/language_tour/built_in_types.dart (trailing-commas)"?>
```dart
var list = ['Car', 'Boat', 'Plane'];
```

Lists use zero-based indexing, where 0 is the index of the first element
and `list.length - 1` is the index of the last element.
You can get a list's length using the `.length` property
and access a list's elements using the subscript operator (`[]`):

<?code-excerpt "misc/test/language_tour/built_in_types_test.dart (list-indexing)"?>
```dart
var list = [1, 2, 3];
assert(list.length == 3);
assert(list[1] == 2);

list[1] = 1;
assert(list[1] == 1);
```

To create a list that's a compile-time constant,
add `const` before the list literal:

<?code-excerpt "misc/lib/language_tour/built_in_types.dart (const-list)"?>
```dart
var constantList = const [1, 2, 3];
// constantList[1] = 1; // This line will cause an error.
```

For more information about lists, refer to the Lists section of the
[`dart:core` documentation](/libraries/dart-core#lists).

[`List`]: {{site.dart-api}}/dart-core/List-class.html
[type inference]: /language/type-system#type-inference

## Sets

A set in Dart is an unordered collection of unique elements.
Dart support for sets is provided by set literals and the
[`Set`][] type.

Here is a simple Dart set, created using a set literal:

<?code-excerpt "misc/lib/language_tour/built_in_types.dart (set-literal)"?>
```dart
var halogens = {'fluorine', 'chlorine', 'bromine', 'iodine', 'astatine'};
```

:::note
Dart infers that `halogens` has the type `Set<String>`. If you try to add the
wrong type of element to the set, the analyzer or runtime raises an error. For
more information, read about
[type inference.](/language/type-system#type-inference)
:::

To create an empty set, use `{}` preceded by a type argument,
or assign `{}` to a variable of type `Set`:

<?code-excerpt "misc/lib/language_tour/built_in_types.dart (set-vs-map)"?>
```dart
var names = <String>{};
// Set<String> names = {}; // This works, too.
// var names = {}; // Creates a map, not a set.
```

:::note Set or map?
The syntax for map literals is similar to that for set
literals. Because map literals came first, `{}` defaults to the `Map` type. If
you forget the type annotation on `{}` or the variable it's assigned to, then
Dart creates an object of type `Map<dynamic, dynamic>`.
:::

Add items to an existing set using the `add()` or `addAll()` methods:

<?code-excerpt "misc/lib/language_tour/built_in_types.dart (set-add-items)"?>
```dart
var elements = <String>{};
elements.add('fluorine');
elements.addAll(halogens);
```

Use `.length` to get the number of items in the set:

<?code-excerpt "misc/test/language_tour/built_in_types_test.dart (set-length)"?>
```dart
var elements = <String>{};
elements.add('fluorine');
elements.addAll(halogens);
assert(elements.length == 5);
```

To create a set that's a compile-time constant,
add `const` before the set literal:

<?code-excerpt "misc/lib/language_tour/built_in_types.dart (const-set)"?>
```dart
final constantSet = const {
  'fluorine',
  'chlorine',
  'bromine',
  'iodine',
  'astatine',
};
// constantSet.add('helium'); // This line will cause an error.
```

For more information about sets, refer to the Sets section of the
[`dart:core` documentation](/libraries/dart-core#sets).

[`Set`]: {{site.dart-api}}/dart-core/Set-class.html

## Maps

In a map, each element is a key-value pair. Each key within
a pair is associated with a value, and both keys and values
can be any type of object. Each key can occur only once,
although the same value can be associated with multiple
different keys. Dart support for maps is provided by
map literals and the [`Map`][] type.

Here are a couple of simple Dart maps, created using map literals:

<?code-excerpt "misc/lib/language_tour/built_in_types.dart (map-literal)"?>
```dart
var gifts = {
  // Key:    Value
  'first': 'partridge',
  'second': 'turtledoves',
  'fifth': 'golden rings',
};

var nobleGases = {2: 'helium', 10: 'neon', 18: 'argon'};
```

:::note
Dart infers that `gifts` has the type `Map<String, String>` and `nobleGases`
has the type `Map<int, String>`. If you try to add the wrong type of value to
either map, the analyzer or runtime raises an error. For more information,
read about [type inference][].
:::

You can create the same objects using a Map constructor:

<?code-excerpt "misc/lib/language_tour/built_in_types.dart (map-constructor)"?>
```dart
var gifts = Map<String, String>();
gifts['first'] = 'partridge';
gifts['second'] = 'turtledoves';
gifts['fifth'] = 'golden rings';

var nobleGases = Map<int, String>();
nobleGases[2] = 'helium';
nobleGases[10] = 'neon';
nobleGases[18] = 'argon';
```

:::note
If you come from a language like C# or Java, you might expect to see `new Map()` 
instead of just `Map()`. In Dart, the `new` keyword is optional.
For details, see [Using constructors][].
:::

Add a new key-value pair to an existing map
using the subscript assignment operator (`[]=`):

<?code-excerpt "misc/lib/language_tour/built_in_types.dart (map-add-item)"?>
```dart
var gifts = {'first': 'partridge'};
gifts['fourth'] = 'calling birds'; // Add a key-value pair
```

Retrieve a value from a map using the subscript operator (`[]`):

<?code-excerpt "misc/test/language_tour/built_in_types_test.dart (map-retrieve-item)"?>
```dart
var gifts = {'first': 'partridge'};
assert(gifts['first'] == 'partridge');
```

If you look for a key that isn't in a map, you get `null` in return:

<?code-excerpt "misc/test/language_tour/built_in_types_test.dart (map-missing-key)"?>
```dart
var gifts = {'first': 'partridge'};
assert(gifts['fifth'] == null);
```

Use `.length` to get the number of key-value pairs in the map:

<?code-excerpt "misc/test/language_tour/built_in_types_test.dart (map-length)"?>
```dart
var gifts = {'first': 'partridge'};
gifts['fourth'] = 'calling birds';
assert(gifts.length == 2);
```

To create a map that's a compile-time constant,
add `const` before the map literal:

<?code-excerpt "misc/lib/language_tour/built_in_types.dart (const-map)"?>
```dart
final constantMap = const {2: 'helium', 10: 'neon', 18: 'argon'};

// constantMap[2] = 'Helium'; // This line will cause an error.
```

For more information about maps, refer to the Maps section of the
[`dart:core` documentation](/libraries/dart-core#maps).

## Collection elements {: #collection-elements }

A collection literal contains a series of elements. During
runtime, each element is evaluated, producing zero or more
values that are then inserted into the resulting collection.
These elements fall into two main categories: leaf elements
and control flow elements.

*   Leaf element: Inserts an individual item into a
    collection literal.
    
    *   Expression element: Evaluates a single
        expression and inserts the resulting value
        into the collection.

    *   Map entry element: Evaluates a pair of key and value
        expressions and inserts the resulting entry into the
        collection. 

*   Control flow element: Conditionally or iteratively adds
    zero or more values to the surrounding collection.

    *   Null-aware element: Evaluates an expression and if
        the result is not `null`, inserts the value into the
        surrounding collection.

    *   Spread element: Iterates over a given sequence
        (collection expression) and inserts all of the
        resulting values into the surrounding collection.
    
    *   Null-aware spread element: Similar to the
        spread element, but allows the collection to be
        `null` and inserts nothing if it is.

    *   If element: Conditionally evaluates an inner element
        based on given a condition expression, and
        optionally evaluates another `else` element if the
        condition is false.

    *   For element: Iterates and repeatedly evaluates a
        given inner element, inserting zero or more
        resulting values.

To learn more about collection elements, see the following
sections.

<a id="collection-operators" aria-hidden="true"></a>

### Expression elements {: #expression-element }

An expression element evaluates a single expression
and inserts the resulting value into a collection. This
expression can encompass various constructs like
literals, variables, operators, function calls, and
constructor calls.

An expression element has this syntax in a collection:

```dart
<expression>
```

### Map entry elements {: #map-entry-element }

A map entry element evaluates a pair of key and value
expressions and inserts the resulting entry into a
collection. Both the key and the value within this pair can
be expressions.

A map entry element has this syntax in a collection:

```dart
<key_expression>: <value_expression>
```

### Null-aware elements {: #null-aware-element }

A null-aware element evaluates an expression and if the
result is not `null`, inserts the value into the surrounding
collection.

:::version-note
Null-aware collection elements require
a [language version][] of at least 3.8.
:::

A null-aware element has the following syntax in an
expression element:

```dart
?<expression>
```

A null-aware element has the following syntax in a
map entry element:

```dart
// key is a null-aware element
?<key_expression>: <value_expression>
```

```dart
// value is a null-aware element
<key_expression>: ?<value_expression>
```

```dart
// key and value are null-aware elements
?<key_expression>: ?<value_expression>
```

In the following example, the result for the
null-aware element `?a` is not added to a list called
`items` because `a` is `null`:

<?code-excerpt "misc/test/language_tour/collections/null_aware_element_a.dart (code-sample)"?>
```dart
int? absentValue = null;
int? presentValue = 3;
var items = [
  1,
  ?absentValue,
  ?presentValue,
  absentValue,
  5,
]; // [1, 3, null, 5]
```

The following example illustrates various ways that
you can use null-aware elements inside of
map entry elements:

<?code-excerpt "misc/test/language_tour/collections/null_aware_element_b.dart (code-sample)"?>
```dart
String? presentKey = 'Apple';
String? absentKey = null;

int? presentValue = 3;
int? absentValue = null;

var itemsA = {presentKey: absentValue}; // {Apple: null}
var itemsB = {presentKey: ?absentValue}; // {}

var itemsC = {absentKey: presentValue}; // {null: 3}
var itemsD = {?absentKey: presentValue}; // {}

var itemsE = {absentKey: absentValue}; // {null: null}
var itemsF = {?absentKey: ?absentValue}; // {}
```

[language version]: /resources/language/evolution#language-versioning

### Spread elements {: #spread-element }

The spread element iterates over a given sequence and
inserts all of the resulting values into the surrounding
collection.

A spread element has the following syntax in a collection.
The sequence expression can represent any expression that
evaluates to an object that implements `Iterable`:

```dart
...<sequence_expression>
```

In the following example, the elements in a list called `a`
are added to a list called `items`.

<?code-excerpt "misc/test/language_tour/collections/spread_operator_in_collection_a.dart (code_sample)"?>
```dart
var a = [1, 2, null, 4];
var items = [0, ...a, 5]; // [0, 1, 2, null, 4, 5]
```

If you are spreading an expression that might evaluate to
`null` and you want to ignore the `null` (and insert no
elements), use a [null-aware spread element][].

To learn more about the spread operator, see
[Spread operator][].

[Spread operator]: /language/operators/#spread-operators
[null-aware spread element]: #null-spread-element

### Null-aware spread elements {: #null-spread-element }

The null-aware spread element is similar to the
spread element, but allows the collection to be `null` and
inserts nothing if it is.

A null-aware spread element has this syntax in a
collection:

```dart
...?<sequence_expression>
```

In the following example, a list called `a` is ignored
because it's null, but the elements in a list called `b`
are added to a list called `items`. Notice that if a
collection itself is not `null`, but it contains elements that
are, those `null` elements are still added to the result.

```dart
List<int>? a = null;
var b = [1, null, 3];
var items = [0, ...?a, ...?b, 4]; // [0, 1, null, 3, 4]
```

Because of null safety, you can't perform a
spread operation (`...`) on a value that might be null. The
following example produces a compile-time error because the 
`extraOptions` parameter is nullable and the
spread operator used on `extraOptions` is not null-aware.

<?code-excerpt "misc/test/language_tour/collections/null_spread_operator_in_collection_b.dart (code_sample)"?>
```dart tag=fails-sa
List<String> buildCommandLine(
  String executable,
  List<String> options, [
  List<String>? extraOptions,
]) {
  return [
    executable,
    ...options,
    ...extraOptions, // <-- Error
  ];
}

// Usage:
//   buildCommandLine('dart', ['run', 'my_script.dart'], null);
// Result:
//   Compile-time error
```

If you want to spread a nullable collection, use a
null-aware spread element. The following example is valid
because the null-aware spread operator is used on `extraOptions`.

<?code-excerpt "misc/test/language_tour/collections/null_spread_operator_in_collection_a.dart (code_sample)"?>
```dart
List<String> buildCommandLine(
  String executable,
  List<String> options, [
  List<String>? extraOptions,
]) {
  return [
    executable,
    ...options,
    ...?extraOptions, // <-- OK now.
  ];
}

// Usage:
//   buildCommandLine('dart', ['run', 'my_script.dart'], null);
// Result:
//   [dart, run, my_script.dart]
```

To learn more about the null-aware spread operator, see
[Spread operator][].

[Spread operator]: /language/operators/#spread-operators

### If elements {: #if-element }

An `if` element conditionally evaluates an inner element
based on given a condition expression, and optionally
evaluates another `else` element if the condition is false.

The `if` element has a few syntax variations:

```dart
// If the bool expression is true, include the result.
if (<bool_expression>) <result>
```

```dart
// If the expression matches the pattern, include the result.
if (<expression> case <pattern>) <result>
```

```dart
// If the operation resolves as true, include the first
// result, otherwise, include the second result.
if (<bool_expression>) <result> else <result>
```

```dart
// If the operation resolves as true, include the first
// result, otherwise, include the second result.
if (<expression> case <pattern>) <result> else <result>
```

The following examples illustrate various ways that
you can use an `if` element inside of a collection with
a boolean expression:

<?code-excerpt "misc/test/language_tour/collections/if_case_operator_in_collection_e.dart (code_sample)"?>
```dart
var includeItem = true;
var items = [0, if (includeItem) 1, 2, 3]; // [0, 1, 2, 3]
```

<?code-excerpt "misc/test/language_tour/collections/if_case_operator_in_collection_f.dart (code_sample)"?>
```dart
var includeItem = true;
var items = [0, if (!includeItem) 1, 2, 3]; // [0, 2, 3]
```

<?code-excerpt "misc/test/language_tour/collections/if_case_operator_in_collection_g.dart (code_sample)"?>
```dart
var name = 'apple';
var items = [0, if (name == 'orange') 1 else 10, 2, 3]; // [0, 10, 2, 3]
```

<?code-excerpt "misc/test/language_tour/collections/if_case_operator_in_collection_h.dart (code_sample)"?>
```dart
var name = 'apple';
var items = [
  0,
  if (name == 'kiwi') 1 else if (name == 'pear') 10,
  2,
  3,
]; // [0, 2, 3]
```

The following examples illustrate various ways that
you can use an `if` element with a `case` part inside of a
collection:

<?code-excerpt "misc/test/language_tour/collections/if_case_operator_in_collection_a.dart (code_sample)"?>
```dart
Object data = 123;
var typeInfo = [
  if (data case int i) 'Data is an integer: $i',
  if (data case String s) 'Data is a string: $s',
  if (data case bool b) 'Data is a boolean: $b',
  if (data case double d) 'Data is a double: $d',
]; // [Data is an integer: 123, Data is a double: 123]
```

<?code-excerpt "misc/test/language_tour/collections/if_case_operator_in_collection_d.dart (code_sample)"?>
```dart
var word = 'hello';
var items = [
  1,
  if (word case String(length: var wordLength)) wordLength,
  3,
]; // [1, 5, 3]
```

<?code-excerpt "misc/test/language_tour/collections/if_case_operator_in_collection_b.dart (code_sample)"?>
```dart
var orderDetails = ['Apples', 12, ''];
var summary = [
  'Product: ${orderDetails[0]}',
  if (orderDetails case [_, int qty, _]) 'Quantity: $qty',
  if (orderDetails case [_, _, ''])
    'Delivery: Not Started'
  else
    'Delivery: In Progress',
]; // [Product: Apples, Quantity: 12, Delivery: Not Started]
```

You can mix different `if` operations with an `else if`
part. For example:

<?code-excerpt "misc/test/language_tour/collections/if_case_operator_in_collection_c.dart (code_sample)"?>
```dart
var a = 'apple';
var b = 'orange';
var c = 'mango';
var items = [
  0,
  if (a == 'apple') 1 else if (a case 'mango') 10,
  if (b case 'pear') 2 else if (b == 'mango') 20,
  if (c case 'apple') 3 else if (c case 'mango') 30,
  4,
]; // [0, 1, 30, 4]
```

To learn more about the `if` conditional, see
[`if` statement][]. To learn more about the `if-case`
conditional, see [`if-case` statement][].

[`if` statement]: /language/branches#if
[`if-case` statement]: /language/branches#if-case

### For elements {: #for-element }

A `for` element iterates and repeatedly evaluates a given
inner element, inserting zero or more resulting values.

A `for` element has this syntax in a collection:

```dart
for (<expression> in <collection>) <result>
```

```dart
for (<initialization_clause>; <condition_clause>; <increment_clause>) <result>
```

The following examples illustrate various ways that
you can use a `for` element inside of a collection:

<?code-excerpt "misc/test/language_tour/collections/for_loop_in_collection_a.dart (code_sample)"?>
```dart
var numbers = [2, 3, 4];
var items = [1, for (var n in numbers) n * n, 7]; // [1, 4, 9, 16, 7]
```

<?code-excerpt "misc/test/language_tour/collections/for_loop_in_collection_b.dart (code_sample)"?>
```dart
var items = [1, for (var x = 5; x > 2; x--) x, 7]; // [1, 5, 4, 3, 7]
```

<?code-excerpt "misc/test/language_tour/collections/for_loop_in_collection_c.dart (code_sample)"?>
```dart
var items = [1, for (var x = 2; x < 4; x++) x, 7]; // [1, 2, 3, 4, 7]
```

To learn more about the `for` loop, see
[`for` loops][].

[`for` loops]: /language/loops/#for-loops

### Nest control flow elements {: #nesting-elements }

You can nest control flow elements within each other. This
is a powerful alternative to list comprehensions in other
languages.

In the following example, only the even numbers in
`numbers` are included in `items`.

<?code-excerpt "misc/test/language_tour/collections/nesting_in_collection_a.dart (code_sample)"?>
```dart
var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7];
var items = [
  0,
  for (var n in numbers)
    if (n.isEven) n,
  8,
]; // [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]
```

It's common and idiomatic to use a spread on a collection
literal immediately inside of an `if` or `for` element. For
example:

<?code-excerpt "misc/test/language_tour/collections/nesting_in_collection_c.dart (code_sample)"?>
```dart
var items = [
  if (condition) oneThing(),
  if (condition) ...[multiple(), things()],
]; // [oneThing, [multiple_a, multiple_b], things]
```

You can nest all kinds of elements arbitrarily deep.
In the following example, `if`, `for` and spread elements
are nested within each other in a collection:

<?code-excerpt "misc/test/language_tour/collections/nesting_in_collection_b.dart (code_sample)"?>
```dart
var nestItems = true;
var ys = [1, 2, 3, 4];
var items = [
  if (nestItems) ...[
    for (var x = 0; x < 3; x++)
      for (var y in ys)
        if (x < y) x + y * 10,
  ],
]; // [10, 20, 30, 40, 21, 31, 41, 32, 42]
```
