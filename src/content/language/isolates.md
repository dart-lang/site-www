This page discusses some examples that use the `Isolate` API to implement 
isolates.

You should use isolates whenever your application is handling computations that 
are large enough to temporarily block other computations.
The most common example is in [Flutter][] applications, when you 
need to perform large computations that might otherwise cause the 
UI to become unresponsive.

There aren't any rules about when you _must_ use isolates, 
but here are some more situations where they can be useful:

- Parsing and decoding exceptionally large JSON blobs.
- Processing and compressing photos, audio and video.
- Converting audio and video files.
- Performing complex searching and filtering on large lists or within
  file systems.
- Performing I/O, such as communicating with a database.
- Handling a large volume of network requests.

## Implementing a simple worker isolate

These examples implement a main isolate
that spawns a simple worker isolate.
[`Isolate.run()`][] simplifies the steps behind
setting up and managing worker isolates:

1. Spawns (starts and creates) an isolate.
2. Runs a function on the spawned isolate.
3. Captures the result.
4. Returns the result to the main isolate.
5. Terminates the isolate once work is complete.
6. Checks, captures, and throws exceptions and errors back to the main isolate.

[`Isolate.run()`]: {{site.dart-api}}/dev/dart-isolate/Isolate/run.html

:::flutter-note
If you're using Flutter, you can use [Flutter's `compute` function][]
instead of `Isolate.run()`.
:::

[Flutter's `compute` function]: {{site.flutter-api}}/flutter/foundation/compute.html

### Running an existing method in a new isolate

1. Call `run()` to spawn a new isolate (a [background worker][]),
   directly in the [main isolate][] while `main()` waits for the result:

<?code-excerpt "lib/simple_worker_isolate.dart (main)"?>
```dart
const String filename = 'with_keys.json';

void main() async {
  // Read some data.
  final jsonData = await Isolate.run(_readAndParseJson);

  // Use that data.
  print('Number of JSON keys: ${jsonData.length}');
}
```

2. Pass the worker isolate the function you want it to execute
   as its first argument. In this example, it's the existing function `_readAndParseJson()`:

<?code-excerpt "lib/simple_worker_isolate.dart (spawned)"?>
```dart
Future<Map<String, dynamic>> _readAndParseJson() async {
  final fileData = await File(filename).readAsString();
  final jsonData = jsonDecode(fileData) as Map<String, dynamic>;
  return jsonData;
}
```

3. `Isolate.run()` takes the result `_readAndParseJson()` returns
   and sends the value back to the main isolate,
   shutting down the worker isolate.

4. The worker isolate *transfers* the memory holding the result
   to the main isolate. It *does not copy* the data.
   The worker isolate performs a verification pass to ensure
   the objects are allowed to be transferred.

`_readAndParseJson()` is an existing,
asynchronous function that could just as easily
run directly in the main isolate.
Using `Isolate.run()` to run it instead enables concurrency.
The worker isolate completely abstracts the computations
of `_readAndParseJson()`. It can complete without blocking the main isolate.

The result of `Isolate.run()` is always a Future,
because code in the main isolate continues to run.
Whether the computation the worker isolate executes
is synchronous or asynchronous doesn't impact the
main isolate, because it's running concurrently either way.

For the complete program, check out the [send_and_receive.dart][] sample.

[send_and_receive.dart]: https://github.com/dart-lang/samples/blob/main/isolates/bin/send_and_receive.dart
[background worker]: /language/concurrency#background-workers
[main isolate]: /language/concurrency#the-main-isolate

### Sending closures with isolates

You can also create a simple worker isolate with `run()` using a
function literal, or closure, directly in the main isolate.

<?code-excerpt "lib/simple_isolate_closure.dart"?>
```dart
const String filename = 'with_keys.json';

void main() async {
  // Read some data.
  final jsonData = await Isolate.run(() async {
    final fileData = await File(filename).readAsString();
    final jsonData = jsonDecode(fileData) as Map<String, dynamic>;
    return jsonData;
  });

  // Use that data.
  print('Number of JSON keys: ${jsonData.length}');
}
```

This example accomplishes the same as the previous.
A new isolate spawns, computes something, and sends back the result.

However, now the isolate sends a [closure][].
Closures are less limited than typical named functions,
both in how they function and how they're written into the code.
In this example, `Isolate.run()` executes what looks like local code, 
concurrently. In that sense, you can imagine `run()` to work like a 
control flow operator for "run in parallel".

[closure]: /language/functions#anonymous-functions

## Sending multiple messages between isolates with ports

Short-lived isolates are convenient to use,
but require performance overhead to spawn new isolates
and to copy objects from one isolate to another.
If your code relies on repeatedly running the same computation 
using `Isolate.run`, you might improve performance by instead creating
long-lived isolates that don’t exit immediately.

To do this, you can use some of the low-level isolate APIs that 
`Isolate.run` abstracts:

* [`Isolate.spawn()`][] and [`Isolate.exit()`][]
* [`ReceivePort`][] and [`SendPort`][]
* [`SendPort.send()` method][]


This section goes over the steps required to establish
2-way communication between a newly spawned isolate
and the [main isolate][].
The first example, [Basic ports](#basic-ports-example), introduces the process
at a high-level. The second example, [Robust ports](#robust-ports-example),
gradually adds more practical, real-world functionality to the first.

### `ReceivePort` and `SendPort`

Setting up long-lived communication between isolates requires
two classes (in addition to `Isolate`): `ReceivePort` and `SendPort`.
These ports are the only way isolates can communicate with each other.

A `ReceivePort` is an object that handles messages that are sent from other
isolates. Those messages are sent via a `SendPort`.

:::note
A `SendPort` object is associated with exactly one `ReceivePort`,
but a single `ReceivePort` can have many `SendPorts`.
When you create a `ReceivePort`, it creates a `SendPort` for itself.
You can create additional `SendPorts` that
can send messages to an existing `ReceivePort`.
:::

Ports behave similarly to [`Stream`][] objects 
(in fact, receive ports implement `Stream`!)
You can think of a `SendPort` and `ReceivePort` like
Stream's `StreamController` and listeners, respectively.
A `SendPort` is like a `StreamController` because you "add" messages to them
with the [`SendPort.send()` method][], and those messages are handled by a listener,
in this case the `ReceivePort`. The `ReceivePort` then handles the messages it
receives by passing them as arguments to a callback that you provide. 

#### Setting up ports

A newly spawned isolate only has the information it receives through the
`Isolate.spawn` call. If you need the main isolate to continue to communicate
with a spawned isolate past its initial creation, you must set up a 
communication channel where the spawned isolate can send messages to the 
main isolate. Isolates can only communicate via message passing. 
They can’t “see”  inside each others’ memory, 
which is where the name “isolate” comes from.

To set up this 2-way communication, first create a [`ReceivePort`][] 
in the main isolate, then pass its [`SendPort`][] as an argument to the 
new isolate when spawning it with `Isolate.spawn`.
The new isolate then creates its own `ReceivePort`, and sends _its_ `SendPort`
back on the `SendPort` it was passed by the main isolate.
The main isolate receives this `SendPort`, and
now both sides have an open channel to send and receive messages.

:::note
The diagrams in this section are high-level and intended to convey the 
_concept_ of using ports for isolates. Actual implementation requires 
a bit more code, which you will find 
[later on this page](#basic-ports-example).  
:::

![A figure showing events being fed, one by one, into the event loop](/assets/img/language/concurrency/ports-setup.png)

1. Create a `ReceivePort` in the main isolate. The `SendPort` is created
   automatically as a property on the `ReceivePort`.
2. Spawn the worker isolate with `Isolate.spawn()`
3. Pass a reference to `ReceivePort.sendPort` as the first message to the
   worker isolate.
4. Create another new `ReceivePort` in the worker isolate.
5. Pass a reference to the worker isolate's `ReceivePort.sendPort` as the
   first message _back_ to the main isolate.

Along with creating the ports and setting up communication, you’ll also need
to tell the ports what to do when they receive messages. This is done using
the `listen` method on each respective `ReceivePort`.

![A figure showing events being fed, one by one, into the event loop](/assets/img/language/concurrency/ports-passing-messages.png)

1. Send a message via the main isolate’s reference to the worker isolate's
   `SendPort`.
2. Receive and handle the message via a listener on the worker isolate's
   `ReceivePort`. This is where the computation you want to move off the
   main isolate is executed.
3. Send a return message via the worker isolate's reference to the main
   isolate's `SendPort`.
4. Receive the message via a listener on the main isolate's `ReceivePort`.

### Basic ports example

This example demonstrates how you can set up a long-lived worker isolate
with 2-way communication between it and the main isolate.
The code uses the example of sending JSON text to a new isolate,
where the JSON will be parsed and decoded,
before being sent back to the main isolate.

:::warning
This example is meant to teach the _bare minimum_ needed to
spawn a new isolate that can send and receive multiple messages over time.

It does not cover important pieces of functionality that are expected
in production software, like error handling, shutting down ports,
and message sequencing.

The [Robust ports example][] in the next section covers this functionality and
discusses some of the issues that can arise without it.
:::

[robust ports example]: #robust-ports-example

#### Step 1: Define the worker class

First, create a class for your background worker isolate. 
This class contains all the functionality you need to:

- Spawn an isolate.
- Send messages to that isolate.
- Have the isolate decode some JSON.
- Send the decoded JSON back to the main isolate.

The class exposes two public methods: one that spawns the worker 
isolate, and one that handles sending messages to that worker isolate.

The remaining sections in this example will show you
how to fill in the class methods, one-by-one.

<?code-excerpt "lib/basic_ports_example/start.dart"?>
```dart
class Worker {
  Future<void> spawn() async {
    // TODO: Add functionality to spawn a worker isolate.
  }

  void _handleResponsesFromIsolate(dynamic message) {
    // TODO: Handle messages sent back from the worker isolate.
  }

  static void _startRemoteIsolate(SendPort port) {
    // TODO: Define code that should be executed on the worker isolate.
  }

  Future<void> parseJson(String message) async {
    // TODO: Define a public method that can
    // be used to send messages to the worker isolate.
  }
}
```

#### Step 2: Spawn a worker isolate

The `Worker.spawn` method is where you will group the code for creating the 
worker isolate and ensuring it can receive and send messages.

- First, create a `ReceivePort`. This allows the main isolate to receive
  messages sent from the newly spawned worker isolate.
- Next, add a listener to the receive port to handle messages the worker isolate
  will send back. The callback passed to the
  listener, `_handleResponsesFromIsolate`, will be covered
  in [step 4](#step-4-handle-messages-on-the-main-isolate).
- Finally, spawn the worker isolate with `Isolate.spawn`. It expects two
  arguments: a function to be executed on the worker isolate
  (covered in [step 3](#step-3-execute-code-on-the-worker-isolate)),
  and the `sendPort` property of the receive port.

<?code-excerpt "lib/basic_ports_example/complete.dart (spawn)"?>
```dart
Future<void> spawn() async {
  final receivePort = ReceivePort();
  receivePort.listen(_handleResponsesFromIsolate);
  await Isolate.spawn(_startRemoteIsolate, receivePort.sendPort);
}
```

The `receivePort.sendPort` argument will be passed to the
callback (`_startRemoteIsolate`) as an argument when it’s called on the
worker isolate. This is the first step in ensuring that the worker isolate has a
way to send messages back to the main isolate.

#### Step 3: Execute code on the worker isolate

In this step, you define the method `_startRemoteIsolate` that is sent to the
worker isolate to be executed when it spawns. This method is like the “main”
method for the worker isolate.

- First, create another new `ReceivePort`. This port receives
  future messages from the main isolate.
- Next, send that port’s  `SendPort` back to the main isolate.
- Finally, add a listener to the new `ReceivePort`. This listener handles
  messages the main isolate sends to the worker isolate.

<?code-excerpt "lib/basic_ports_example/complete.dart (start-remote-isolate)"?>
```dart
static void _startRemoteIsolate(SendPort port) {
  final receivePort = ReceivePort();
  port.send(receivePort.sendPort);

  receivePort.listen((dynamic message) async {
    if (message is String) {
      final transformed = jsonDecode(message);
      port.send(transformed);
    }
  });
}
```

The listener on the worker’s `ReceivePort` decodes the JSON passed from the main
isolate, and then sends the decoded JSON back to the main isolate.

This listener is the entry point for messages sent from the main isolate to the
worker isolate. **This is the only chance you have to tell the worker isolate what code
to execute in the future.**

#### Step 4: Handle messages on the main isolate

Finally, you need to tell the main isolate how to handle messages sent from the
worker isolate back to the main isolate. To do so, you need to fill in
the `_handleResponsesFromIsolate` method. Recall that this method is passed to
the `receivePort.listen` method, as described
in [step 2](#step-2-spawn-a-worker-isolate):

<?code-excerpt "lib/basic_ports_example/complete.dart (spawn)"?>
```dart
Future<void> spawn() async {
  final receivePort = ReceivePort();
  receivePort.listen(_handleResponsesFromIsolate);
  await Isolate.spawn(_startRemoteIsolate, receivePort.sendPort);
}
```

Also recall that you sent a `SendPort` back to the main isolate
in [step 3](#step-3-execute-code-on-the-worker-isolate). This method handles the
receipt of that `SendPort`, as well as handling future messages (which will be
decoded JSON).

- First, check if the message is a `SendPort`. If so, assign that port to the
  class's `_sendPort` property so it can be used to send messages later.
- Next, check if the message is of type `Map<String, dynamic>`, the expected
  type of decoded JSON. If so, handle that message with your
  application-specific logic. In this example, the message is printed. 

<?code-excerpt "lib/basic_ports_example/complete.dart (handle-responses)"?>
```dart
void _handleResponsesFromIsolate(dynamic message) {
  if (message is SendPort) {
    _sendPort = message;
    _isolateReady.complete();
  } else if (message is Map<String, dynamic>) {
    print(message);
  }
}
```

#### Step 5: Add a completer to ensure your isolate is set-up

To complete the class, define a public method called `parseJson`, which is
responsible for sending messages to the worker isolate. It also needs to ensure
that messages can be sent before the isolate is fully set up.
To handle this, use a [`Completer`][].

- First, add a class-level property called a `Completer` and name
  it `_isolateReady`.
- Next, add a call to `complete()` on the completer in
  the `_handleResponsesFromIsolate` method (created in [step 4](#step-4-handle-messages-on-the-main-isolate)) if the message is
  a `SendPort`.
- Finally, in the `parseJson` method, add `await _isolateReady.future` before
  adding `_sendPort.send`. This ensures that no message can be sent to the
  worker isolate until it is spawned _and_ has sent its `SendPort` back to the
  main isolate.

<?code-excerpt "lib/basic_ports_example/complete.dart (parse-json)"?>
```dart
Future<void> parseJson(String message) async {
  await _isolateReady.future;
  _sendPort.send(message);
}
```

### Robust ports example

The [previous example][] explained the basic building blocks needed to set up a
long-lived isolate with two-way communication. As mentioned, that example lacks
some important features, such as error handling, the ability to close the
ports when they’re no longer in use, and inconsistencies around message ordering
in some situations.

This example expands on the information in the first example by creating a
long-lived worker isolate that has these additional features and more, and
follows better design patterns. Although this code has similarities to the first
example, it is not an extension of that example.

:::note
This example assumes that you are already familiar with
establishing communication between isolates with `Isolate.spawn` and ports,
which was covered in the [previous example][]. 
:::

#### Step 1: Define the worker class

First, create a class for your background worker isolate. This class contains
all the functionality you need to:

- Spawn an isolate.
- Send messages to that isolate.
- Have the isolate decode some JSON.
- Send the decoded JSON back to the main isolate.

The class exposes three public methods: one that creates the worker
isolate, one that handles sending messages to that worker isolate, and one
that can shut down the ports when they’re no longer in use.

<?code-excerpt "lib/robust_ports_example/start.dart"?>
```dart
class Worker {
  final SendPort _commands;
  final ReceivePort _responses;

  Future<Object?> parseJson(String message) async {
    // TODO: Ensure the port is still open.
    _commands.send(message);
  }

  static Future<Worker> spawn() async {
    // TODO: Add functionality to create a new Worker object with a
    //  connection to a spawned isolate.
    throw UnimplementedError();
  }

  Worker._(this._commands, this._responses) {
    // TODO: Initialize main isolate receive port listener.
  }

  void _handleResponsesFromIsolate(dynamic message) {
    // TODO: Handle messages sent back from the worker isolate.
  }

  static void _handleCommandsToIsolate(ReceivePort rp, SendPort sp) async {
    // TODO: Handle messages sent back from the worker isolate.
  }

  static void _startRemoteIsolate(SendPort sp) {
    // TODO: Initialize worker isolate's ports.
  }
}
```

:::note
In this example, `SendPort` and `ReceivePort` instances
follow a best practice naming convention, in which they are named in relation to
the main isolate. The messages sent through the `SendPort` from the main isolate
to the worker isolate are called _commands_, and the messages sent back to the
main isolate are called _responses_.
:::

#### Step 2: Create a `RawReceivePort` in the `Worker.spawn` method

Before spawning an isolate, you need to create a [`RawReceivePort`][], which is
a lower-level `ReceivePort`. Using `RawReceivePort` is a preferred pattern
because it allows you to separate your isolate startup logic from logic that
handles message passing on the isolate.

In the `Worker.spawn` method:

- First, create the `RawReceivePort`. This `ReceivePort` is only responsible for
  receiving the initial message from the worker isolate, which will be
  a `SendPort`.
- Next, create a `Completer` that will indicate when the isolate is ready to
  receive messages. When this completes, it will return a record with
  a `ReceivePort` and a `SendPort`.
- Next, define the `RawReceivePort.handler` property. This property is
  a `Function?` that behaves like `ReceivePort.listener`. The function is called
  when a message is received by this port.
- Within the handler function, call `connection.complete()`. This method expects
  a [record][] with a `ReceivePort` and a `SendPort` as an argument.
  The `SendPort` is the initial message sent from the worker isolate, which will
  be assigned in the next step to the class level `SendPort` named `_commands`.
- Then, create a new `ReceivePort` with
  the `ReceivePort.fromRawReceivePort` constructor, and pass in
  the `initPort`.

<?code-excerpt "lib/robust_ports_example/spawn_1.dart"?>
```dart
class Worker {
  final SendPort _commands;
  final ReceivePort _responses;

  static Future<Worker> spawn() async {
    // Create a receive port and add its initial message handler.
    final initPort = RawReceivePort();
    final connection = Completer<(ReceivePort, SendPort)>.sync();
    initPort.handler = (initialMessage) {
      final commandPort = initialMessage as SendPort;
      connection.complete((
        ReceivePort.fromRawReceivePort(initPort),
        commandPort,
      ));
    };
// ···
  }
```

By creating a `RawReceivePort` first, and then a `ReceivePort`, you’ll be able
to add a new callback to `ReceivePort.listen` later on. Conversely, if you were
to create a `ReceivePort` straight away, you’d only be able to add
one `listener`, because `ReceivePort` implements [`Stream`][], rather
than [`BroadcastStream`][].

Effectively, this allows you to separate your isolate start-up logic from the
logic that handles receiving messages after setting up communication is
complete. This benefit will become more obvious as the logic in the other
methods grows.

#### Step 3: Spawn a worker isolate with `Isolate.spawn`

This step continues to fill in the `Worker.spawn` method. You’ll add the code
needed to spawn an isolate, and return an instance of `Worker` from this class.
In this example, the call to `Isolate.spawn` is wrapped in
a [`try`/`catch` block][], which ensures that, if the isolate fails to start up,
the `initPort` will be closed, and the `Worker` object won’t be created.

- First, attempt to spawn a worker isolate in a `try`/`catch` block. If spawning
  a worker isolate fails, close the receive port that was created in the
  previous step. The method passed to `Isolate.spawn` will be covered in a later
  step.
- Next, await the `connection.future`, and destructure the send port and
  receive port from the record it returns.
- Finally, return an instance of `Worker` by calling its private constructor,
  and passing in the ports from that completer.

<?code-excerpt "lib/robust_ports_example/spawn_2.dart"?>
```dart
class Worker {
  final SendPort _commands;
  final ReceivePort _responses;

  static Future<Worker> spawn() async {
    // Create a receive port and add its initial message handler
    final initPort = RawReceivePort();
    final connection = Completer<(ReceivePort, SendPort)>.sync();
    initPort.handler = (initialMessage) {
      final commandPort = initialMessage as SendPort;
      connection.complete((
        ReceivePort.fromRawReceivePort(initPort),
        commandPort,
      ));
    };
    // Spawn the isolate.
    try {
      await Isolate.spawn(_startRemoteIsolate, (initPort.sendPort));
    } on Object {
      initPort.close();
      rethrow;
    }

    final (ReceivePort receivePort, SendPort sendPort) =
        await connection.future;

    return Worker._(sendPort, receivePort);
  }
```

Note that in this example (compared to the [previous example][]), `Worker.spawn`
acts as an asynchronous static constructor for this class and is the only way to
create an instance of `Worker`. This simplifies the API, making the code that
creates an instance of `Worker` cleaner.

#### Step 4: Complete the isolate setup process

In this step, you will complete the basic isolate setup process. This correlates
almost entirely to the [previous example][], and there are no new concepts.
There is a slight change in that the code is broken into more methods, which
is a design practice that
sets you up for adding more functionality through the remainder of this example.
For an in-depth walkthrough of the basic process of setting up an isolate, see
the [basic ports example](#basic-ports-example).

First, create the private constructor that is returned from the `Worker.spawn`
method. In the constructor body, add a listener to the receive port used by the
main isolate, and pass an as-yet undefined method to that listener
called `_handleResponsesFromIsolate`. 

<?code-excerpt "lib/robust_ports_example/step_4.dart (constructor)"?>
```dart
class Worker {
  final SendPort _commands;
  final ReceivePort _responses;
// ···
  Worker._(this._responses, this._commands) {
    _responses.listen(_handleResponsesFromIsolate);
  }
```

Next, add the code to `_startRemoteIsolate` that is responsible for initializing
the ports on the worker
isolate. [Recall](#step-3-spawn-a-worker-isolate-with-isolate-spawn) that this
method was passed to `Isolate.spawn` in the `Worker.spawn` method, and it will
be passed the main isolate’s `SendPort` as an argument.

- Create a new `ReceivePort`.
- Send that port’s `SendPort` back to the main isolate.
- Call a new method called `_handleCommandsToIsolate`, and pass both the
  new `ReceivePort` and `SendPort` from the main isolate as arguments.

<?code-excerpt "lib/robust_ports_example/step_4.dart (start-isolate)"?>
```dart
static void _startRemoteIsolate(SendPort sendPort) {
  final receivePort = ReceivePort();
  sendPort.send(receivePort.sendPort);
  _handleCommandsToIsolate(receivePort, sendPort);
}
```

Next, add the `_handleCommandsToIsolate` method, which is responsible for
receiving messages from the main isolate, decoding json on the worker isolate,
and sending the decoded json back as a response.

- First, declare a listener on the worker isolate’s `ReceivePort`.
- Within the callback added to the listener, attempt to decode the JSON passed
  from the main isolate within a [`try`/`catch` block][]. If decoding is
  successful, send the decoded JSON back to the main isolate.
- If there is an error, send back a [`RemoteError`][].

<?code-excerpt "lib/robust_ports_example/step_4.dart (handle-commands)"?>
```dart
static void _handleCommandsToIsolate(
    ReceivePort receivePort, SendPort sendPort) {
  receivePort.listen((message) {
    try {
      final jsonData = jsonDecode(message as String);
      sendPort.send(jsonData);
    } catch (e) {
      sendPort.send(RemoteError(e.toString(), ''));
    }
  });
}
```

Next, add the code for the `_handleResponsesFromIsolate` method.

- First, check if the message is a `RemoteError`, in which case you
  should `throw` that error.
- Otherwise, print the message. In future steps, you will update this code to
  return messages rather than print them.

<?code-excerpt "lib/robust_ports_example/step_4.dart (handle-response)"?>
```dart
void _handleResponsesFromIsolate(dynamic message) {
  if (message is RemoteError) {
    throw message;
  } else {
    print(message);
  }
}
```

Finally, add the `parseJson` method, which is a public method that allows
outside code to send JSON to the worker isolate to be decoded.

<?code-excerpt "lib/robust_ports_example/step_4.dart (parse-json)"?>
```dart
Future<Object?> parseJson(String message) async {
  _commands.send(message);
}
```

You will update this method in the next step.

#### Step 5: Handle multiple messages at the same time

Currently, if you rapidly send messages to the worker isolate, the isolate will
send the decoded json response in _the order that they complete_, rather than
the order that they’re sent. You have no way to determine which response
corresponds to which message.

In this step, you’ll fix this problem by giving each message an id, and
using `Completer` objects to ensure that when outside code calls `parseJson` the
response that is returned to that caller is the correct response.

First, add two class-level properties to `Worker`:

- `Map<int, Completer<Object?>> _activeRequests`
- `int _idCounter`

<?code-excerpt "lib/robust_ports_example/step_5_add_completers.dart (vars)"?>
```dart
class Worker {
  final SendPort _commands;
  final ReceivePort _responses;
  final Map<int, Completer<Object?>> _activeRequests = {};
  int _idCounter = 0;
```

The `_activeRequests` map associates a message sent to the worker isolate
with a `Completer`. The keys used in `_activeRequests` are taken
from `_idCounter`, which will be increased as more messages are sent.

Next, update the `parseJson` method to create completers before it sends
messages to the worker isolate.

- First create a `Completer`.
- Next, increment `_idCounter`, so that each `Completer` is associated with a
  unique number.
- Add an entry to the `_activeRequests` map in which the key is the current
  number of `_idCounter`, and the completer is the value.
- Send the message to the worker isolate, along with the id. Because you can
  only send one value through the `SendPort`, wrap the id and message in a
  [record][].
- Finally, return the completer’s future, which will eventually contain the
  response from the worker isolate.

<?code-excerpt "lib/robust_ports_example/step_5_add_completers.dart (parse-json)"?>
```dart
Future<Object?> parseJson(String message) async {
  final completer = Completer<Object?>.sync();
  final id = _idCounter++;
  _activeRequests[id] = completer;
  _commands.send((id, message));
  return await completer.future;
}
```

You also need to update `_handleResponsesFromIsolate`
and `_handleCommandsToIsolate` to handle this system.

In `_handleCommandsToIsolate`, you need to account for the `message` being a
record with two values, rather than just the json text. Do so by destructuring
the values from `message`.

Then, after decoding the json, update the call to `sendPort.send` to pass both
the id and the decoded json back to the main isolate, again using a record.

<?code-excerpt "lib/robust_ports_example/step_5_add_completers.dart (handle-commands)"?>
```dart
static void _handleCommandsToIsolate(
    ReceivePort receivePort, SendPort sendPort) {
  receivePort.listen((message) {
    final (int id, String jsonText) = message as (int, String); // New
    try {
      final jsonData = jsonDecode(jsonText);
      sendPort.send((id, jsonData)); // Updated
    } catch (e) {
      sendPort.send((id, RemoteError(e.toString(), '')));
    }
  });
}
```

Finally, update the `_handleResponsesFromIsolate`.

- First, destructure the id and the response from the message argument again.
- Then, remove the completer that corresponds to this request from
  the `_activeRequests` map.
- Lastly, rather than throwing an error or printing the decoded json, complete
  the completer, passing in the response. When this completes, the response will
  be returned to the code that called `parseJson` on the main isolate.

<?code-excerpt "lib/robust_ports_example/step_5_add_completers.dart (handle-response)"?>
```dart
void _handleResponsesFromIsolate(dynamic message) {
  final (int id, Object? response) = message as (int, Object?); // New
  final completer = _activeRequests.remove(id)!; // New

  if (response is RemoteError) {
    completer.completeError(response); // Updated
  } else {
    completer.complete(response); // Updated
  }
}
```

#### Step 6: Add functionality to close the ports

When the isolate is no longer being used by your code, you should close the
ports on the main isolate and the worker isolate.

- First, add a class-level boolean that tracks if the ports are closed.
- Then, add the `Worker.close` method. Within this method:
  - Update `_closed` to be true.
  - Send a final message to the worker isolate.
    This message is a `String` that reads “shutdown”,
    but it could be any object you’d like.
    You will use it in the next code snippet.
- Finally, check if `_activeRequests` is empty. If it is, close down the main
  isolate’s `ReceivePort` named `_responses`.

<?code-excerpt "lib/robust_ports_example/step_6_close_ports.dart (close)"?>
```dart
class Worker {
  bool _closed = false;
// ···
  void close() {
    if (!_closed) {
      _closed = true;
      _commands.send('shutdown');
      if (_activeRequests.isEmpty) _responses.close();
      print('--- port closed --- ');
    }
  }
```

- Next, you need to handle the “shutdown” message in the worker isolate. Add the
  following code to the `_handleCommandsToIsolate` method. This code will check if
  the message is a `String` that reads “shutdown”. If it is, it will close the
  worker isolate’s `ReceivePort`, and return.

<?code-excerpt "lib/robust_ports_example/step_6_close_ports.dart (handle-commands)"?>
```dart
static void _handleCommandsToIsolate(
  ReceivePort receivePort,
  SendPort sendPort,
) {
  receivePort.listen((message) {
    // New if-block.
    if (message == 'shutdown') {
      receivePort.close();
      return;
    }
    final (int id, String jsonText) = message as (int, String);
    try {
      final jsonData = jsonDecode(jsonText);
      sendPort.send((id, jsonData));
    } catch (e) {
      sendPort.send((id, RemoteError(e.toString(), '')));
    }
  });
}
```

- Finally, you should add code to check if the ports are closed before trying to
  send messages. Add one line in the `Worker.parseJson` method.

<?code-excerpt "lib/robust_ports_example/step_6_close_ports.dart (parse-json)"?>
```dart
Future<Object?> parseJson(String message) async {
  if (_closed) throw StateError('Closed'); // New
  final completer = Completer<Object?>.sync();
  final id = _idCounter++;
  _activeRequests[id] = completer;
  _commands.send((id, message));
  return await completer.future;
}
```
