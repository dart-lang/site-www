If you look at the API documentation for the basic array type,
[`List`][], you'll see that the
type is actually `List<E>`. The \<...\> notation marks List as a
*generic* (or *parameterized*) typeâ€”a type that has formal type
parameters. [By convention][], most type variables have single-letter names,
such as E, T, S, K, and V.

## Why use generics?

Generics are often required for type safety, but they have more benefits
than just allowing your code to run:

* Properly specifying generic types results in better generated code.
* You can use generics to reduce code duplication.

If you intend for a list to contain only strings, you can
declare it as `List<String>` (read that as "list of string"). That way
you, your fellow programmers, and your tools can detect that assigning a non-string to
the list is probably a mistake. Here's an example:

```dart tag=fails-sa
var names = <String>[];
names.addAll(['Seth', 'Kathy', 'Lars']);
names.add(42); // Error
```

Another reason for using generics is to reduce code duplication.
Generics let you share a single interface and implementation between
many types, while still taking advantage of static
analysis. For example, say you create an interface for
caching an object:

<?code-excerpt "misc/lib/language_tour/generics/cache.dart (object-cache)"?>
```dart
abstract class ObjectCache {
  Object getByKey(String key);
  void setByKey(String key, Object value);
}
```

You discover that you want a string-specific version of this interface,
so you create another interface:

<?code-excerpt "misc/lib/language_tour/generics/cache.dart (string-cache)"?>
```dart
abstract class StringCache {
  String getByKey(String key);
  void setByKey(String key, String value);
}
```

Later, you decide you want a number-specific version of this
interface... You get the idea.

Generic types can save you the trouble of creating all these interfaces.
Instead, you can create a single interface that takes a type parameter:

<?code-excerpt "misc/lib/language_tour/generics/cache.dart (cache)"?>
```dart
abstract class Cache<T> {
  T getByKey(String key);
  void setByKey(String key, T value);
}
```

In this code, T is the stand-in type. It's a placeholder that you can
think of as a type that a developer will define later.


## Using collection literals

List, set, and map literals can be parameterized. Parameterized literals are
just like the literals you've already seen, except that you add
<code>&lt;<em>type</em>></code> (for lists and sets) or
<code>&lt;<em>keyType</em>, <em>valueType</em>></code> (for maps)
before the opening bracket. Here is an example of using typed literals:

<?code-excerpt "misc/lib/language_tour/generics/misc.dart (collection-literals)"?>
```dart
var names = <String>['Seth', 'Kathy', 'Lars'];
var uniqueNames = <String>{'Seth', 'Kathy', 'Lars'};
var pages = <String, String>{
  'index.html': 'Homepage',
  'robots.txt': 'Hints for web robots',
  'humans.txt': 'We are people, not machines'
};
```


## Using parameterized types with constructors

To specify one or more types when using a constructor, put the types in
angle brackets (`<...>`) just after the class name. For example:

<?code-excerpt "misc/test/language_tour/generics_test.dart (constructor-1)"?>
```dart
var nameSet = Set<String>.from(names);
```

The following code creates a map that has integer keys and values of
type View:

<?code-excerpt "misc/test/language_tour/generics_test.dart (constructor-2)"?>
```dart
var views = Map<int, View>();
```


## Generic collections and the types they contain

Dart generic types are *reified*, which means that they carry their type
information around at runtime. For example, you can test the type of a
collection:

<?code-excerpt "misc/test/language_tour/generics_test.dart (generic-collections)"?>
```dart
var names = <String>[];
names.addAll(['Seth', 'Kathy', 'Lars']);
print(names is List<String>); // true
```

:::note
In contrast, generics in Java use *erasure*, which means that generic
type parameters are removed at runtime. In Java, you can test whether
an object is a List, but you can't test whether it's a `List<String>`.
:::


## Restricting the parameterized type

When implementing a generic type,
you might want to limit the types that can be provided as arguments,
so that the argument must be a subtype of a particular type.
You can do this using `extends`.

A common use case is ensuring that a type is non-nullable
by making it a subtype of `Object`
(instead of the default, [`Object?`][top-and-bottom]).

<?code-excerpt "misc/lib/language_tour/generics/misc.dart (non-nullable)"?>
```dart
class Foo<T extends Object> {
  // Any type provided to Foo for T must be non-nullable.
}
```

You can use `extends` with other types besides `Object`.
Here's an example of extending `SomeBaseClass`,
so that members of `SomeBaseClass` can be called on objects of type `T`:

<?code-excerpt "misc/lib/language_tour/generics/base_class.dart" replace="/extends SomeBaseClass(?=. \{)/[!$&!]/g"?>
```dart
class Foo<T [!extends SomeBaseClass!]> {
  // Implementation goes here...
  String toString() => "Instance of 'Foo<$T>'";
}

class Extender extends SomeBaseClass {...}
```

It's OK to use `SomeBaseClass` or any of its subtypes as the generic argument:

<?code-excerpt "misc/test/language_tour/generics_test.dart (SomeBaseClass-ok)" replace="/Foo.\w+./[!$&!]/g"?>
```dart
var someBaseClassFoo = [!Foo<SomeBaseClass>!]();
var extenderFoo = [!Foo<Extender>!]();
```

It's also OK to specify no generic argument:

<?code-excerpt "misc/test/language_tour/generics_test.dart (no-generic-arg-ok)" replace="/expect\((.*?).toString\(\), .(.*?).\);/print($1); \/\/ $2/g"?>
```dart
var foo = Foo();
print(foo); // Instance of 'Foo<SomeBaseClass>'
```

Specifying any non-`SomeBaseClass` type results in an error:

```dart tag=fails-sa
var foo = [!Foo<Object>!]();
```


## Using generic methods

Methods and functions also allow type arguments:

<!-- {{site.dartpad}}/a02c53b001977efa4d803109900f21bb -->
<!-- https://gist.github.com/a02c53b001977efa4d803109900f21bb -->
<?code-excerpt "misc/test/language_tour/generics_test.dart (method)" replace="/<T.(?=\()|T/[!$&!]/g"?>
```dart
[!T!] first[!<T>!](List<[!T!]> ts) {
  // Do some initial work or error checking, then...
  [!T!] tmp = ts[0];
  // Do some additional checking or processing...
  return tmp;
}
```

Here the generic type parameter on `first` (`<T>`)
allows you to use the type argument `T` in several places:

* In the function's return type (`T`).
* In the type of an argument (`List<T>`).
* In the type of a local variable (`T tmp`).
