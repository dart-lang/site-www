## Exceptions

Your Dart code can throw and catch exceptions. Exceptions are errors
indicating that something unexpected happened. If the exception isn't
caught, the [isolate][] that raised the exception is suspended,
and typically the isolate and its program are terminated.

In contrast to Java, all of Dart's exceptions are unchecked exceptions.
Methods don't declare which exceptions they might throw, and you aren't
required to catch any exceptions.

Dart provides [`Exception`][] and [`Error`][]
types, as well as numerous predefined subtypes. You can, of course,
define your own exceptions. However, Dart programs can throw any
non-null object—not just Exception and Error objects—as an exception.

### Throw

Here's an example of throwing, or *raising*, an exception:

<?code-excerpt "misc/lib/language_tour/exceptions.dart (throw-FormatException)"?>
```dart
throw FormatException('Expected at least 1 section');
```

You can also throw arbitrary objects:

<?code-excerpt "misc/lib/language_tour/exceptions.dart (out-of-llamas)"?>
```dart
throw 'Out of llamas!';
```

:::note
Production-quality code usually throws types that
implement [`Error`][] or [`Exception`][].
:::

Because throwing an exception is an expression, you can throw exceptions
in =\> statements, as well as anywhere else that allows expressions:

<?code-excerpt "misc/lib/language_tour/exceptions.dart (throw-is-an-expression)"?>
```dart
void distanceTo(Point other) => throw UnimplementedError();
```


### Catch

Catching, or capturing, an exception stops the exception from
propagating (unless you rethrow the exception).
Catching an exception gives you a chance to handle it:

<?code-excerpt "misc/lib/language_tour/exceptions.dart (try)"?>
```dart
try {
  breedMoreLlamas();
} on OutOfLlamasException {
  buyMoreLlamas();
}
```

To handle code that can throw more than one type of exception, you can
specify multiple catch clauses. The first catch clause that matches the
thrown object's type handles the exception. If the catch clause does not
specify a type, that clause can handle any type of thrown object:

<?code-excerpt "misc/lib/language_tour/exceptions.dart (try-catch)"?>
```dart
try {
  breedMoreLlamas();
} on OutOfLlamasException {
  // A specific exception
  buyMoreLlamas();
} on Exception catch (e) {
  // Anything else that is an exception
  print('Unknown exception: $e');
} catch (e) {
  // No specified type, handles all
  print('Something really unknown: $e');
}
```

As the preceding code shows, you can use either `on` or `catch` or both.
Use `on` when you need to specify the exception type. Use `catch` when
your exception handler needs the exception object.

You can specify one or two parameters to `catch()`.
The first is the exception that was thrown,
and the second is the stack trace (a [`StackTrace`][] object).

<?code-excerpt "misc/lib/language_tour/exceptions.dart (try-catch-2)" replace="/\(e.*?\)/[!$&!]/g"?>
```dart
try {
  // ···
} on Exception catch [!(e)!] {
  print('Exception details:\n $e');
} catch [!(e, s)!] {
  print('Exception details:\n $e');
  print('Stack trace:\n $s');
}
```

To partially handle an exception,
while allowing it to propagate,
use the `rethrow` keyword.

<?code-excerpt "misc/test/language_tour/exceptions_test.dart (rethrow)" replace="/rethrow;/[!$&!]/g"?>
```dart
void misbehave() {
  try {
    dynamic foo = true;
    print(foo++); // Runtime error
  } catch (e) {
    print('misbehave() partially handled ${e.runtimeType}.');
    [!rethrow;!] // Allow callers to see the exception.
  }
}

void main() {
  try {
    misbehave();
  } catch (e) {
    print('main() finished handling ${e.runtimeType}.');
  }
}
```


### Finally

To ensure that some code runs whether or not an exception is thrown, use
a `finally` clause. If no `catch` clause matches the exception, the
exception is propagated after the `finally` clause runs:

<?code-excerpt "misc/lib/language_tour/exceptions.dart (finally)"?>
```dart
try {
  breedMoreLlamas();
} finally {
  // Always clean up, even if an exception is thrown.
  cleanLlamaStalls();
}
```

The `finally` clause runs after any matching `catch` clauses:

<?code-excerpt "misc/lib/language_tour/exceptions.dart (try-catch-finally)"?>
```dart
try {
  breedMoreLlamas();
} catch (e) {
  print('Error: $e'); // Handle the exception first.
} finally {
  cleanLlamaStalls(); // Then clean up.
}
```

[core library exception docs](/libraries/dart-core#exceptions).

## Assert

During development, use an assert 
statement— `assert(<condition>, <optionalMessage>);` —to
disrupt normal execution if a boolean condition is false. 

<?code-excerpt "misc/test/language_tour/control_flow_test.dart (assert)"?>
```dart
// Make sure the variable has a non-null value.
assert(text != null);

// Make sure the value is less than 100.
assert(number < 100);

// Make sure this is an https URL.
assert(urlString.startsWith('https'));
```

To attach a message to an assertion,
add a string as the second argument to `assert`
(optionally with a [trailing comma][]):

<?code-excerpt "misc/test/language_tour/control_flow_test.dart (assert-with-message)"?>
```dart
assert(urlString.startsWith('https'),
    'URL ($urlString) should start with "https".');
```

The first argument to `assert` can be any expression that
resolves to a boolean value. If the expression's value
is true, the assertion succeeds and execution
continues. If it's false, the assertion fails and an exception (an
[`AssertionError`][]) is thrown.

When exactly do assertions work?
That depends on the tools and framework you're using:

* Flutter enables assertions in [debug mode.][Flutter debug mode]
* Development-only tools such as [`webdev serve`][]
  typically enable assertions by default.
* Some tools, such as [`dart run`][] and [`dart compile js`][]
  support assertions through a command-line flag: `--enable-asserts`.

In production code, assertions are ignored, and
the arguments to `assert` aren't evaluated.
