Use `extends` to create a subclass, and `super` to refer to the
superclass:

<?code-excerpt "misc/lib/language_tour/classes/extends.dart" replace="/extends|super/[!$&!]/g"?>
```dart
class Television {
  void turnOn() {
    _illuminateDisplay();
    _activateIrSensor();
  }
  // ···
}

class SmartTelevision [!extends!] Television {
  void turnOn() {
    [!super!].turnOn();
    _bootNetworkInterface();
    _initializeMemory();
    _upgradeApps();
  }
  // ···
}
```

For another usage of `extends`, see the discussion of
[parameterized types][] on the Generics page.

## Overriding members

Subclasses can override instance methods (including [operators][]),
getters, and setters.
You can use the `@override` annotation to indicate that you are
intentionally overriding a member:

<?code-excerpt "misc/lib/language_tour/metadata/television.dart (override)" replace="/@override/[!$&!]/g"?>
```dart
class Television {
  // ···
  set contrast(int value) {...}
}

class SmartTelevision extends Television {
  [!@override!]
  set contrast(num value) {...}
  // ···
}
```

An overriding method declaration must match
the method (or methods) that it overrides in several ways:

* The return type must be the same type as (or a subtype of)
  the overridden method's return type.
* Parameter types must be the same type as (or a supertype of)
  the overridden method's parameter types.
  In the preceding example, the `contrast` setter of `SmartTelevision`
  changes the parameter type from `int` to a supertype, `num`.
* If the overridden method accepts _n_ positional parameters,
  then the overriding method must also accept _n_ positional parameters.
* A [generic method][] can't override a non-generic one,
  and a non-generic method can't override a generic one.

Sometimes you might want to narrow the type of
a method parameter or an instance variable.
This violates the normal rules, and
it's similar to a downcast in that it can cause a type error at runtime.
Still, narrowing the type is possible
if the code can guarantee that a type error won't occur.
In this case, you can use the
[`covariant` keyword](/guides/language/sound-problems#the-covariant-keyword)
in a parameter declaration.
For details, see the
[Dart language specification][].

:::warning
If you override `==`, you should also override Object's `hashCode` getter.
For an example of overriding `==` and `hashCode`, check out
[Implementing map keys](/libraries/dart-core#implementing-map-keys).

## noSuchMethod()

To detect or react whenever code attempts to use a non-existent method or
instance variable, you can override `noSuchMethod()`:

<?code-excerpt "misc/lib/language_tour/classes/no_such_method.dart" replace="/noSuchMethod(?!,)/[!$&!]/g"?>
```dart
class A {
  // Unless you override noSuchMethod, using a
  // non-existent member results in a NoSuchMethodError.
  @override
  void [!noSuchMethod!](Invocation invocation) {
    print('You tried to use a non-existent member: '
        '${invocation.memberName}');
  }
}
```

You **can't invoke** an unimplemented method unless
**one** of the following is true:

* The receiver has the static type `dynamic`.

* The receiver has a static type that
defines the unimplemented method (abstract is OK),
and the dynamic type of the receiver has an implementation of `noSuchMethod()`
that's different from the one in class `Object`.

For more information, see the informal
[noSuchMethod forwarding specification.](https://github.com/dart-lang/language/blob/main/archive/feature-specifications/nosuchmethod-forwarding.md)
