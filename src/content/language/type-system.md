<?code-excerpt path-base="type_system"?>

The Dart language is type safe: it uses a combination of static type checking
and [runtime checks](#runtime-checks) to
ensure that a variable's value always matches the variable's static type,
sometimes referred to as sound typing.
Although _types_ are mandatory, type _annotations_ are optional
because of [type inference](#type-inference).

One benefit of static type checking is the ability to find bugs
at compile time using Dart's [static analyzer.][analysis]

You can fix most static analysis errors by adding type annotations to generic
classes. The most common generic classes are the collection types
`List<T>` and `Map<K,V>`.

For example, in the following code the `printInts()` function prints an integer list,
and `main()` creates a list and passes it to `printInts()`.

<?code-excerpt "lib/strong_analysis.dart (opening-example)" replace="/list(?=\))/[!$&!]/g"?>
```dart tag=fails-sa
void printInts(List<int> a) => print(a);

void main() {
  final list = [];
  list.add(1);
  list.add('2');
  printInts([!list!]);
}
```

The preceding code results in a type error on `list` (highlighted
above) at the call of `printInts(list)`:

<?code-excerpt "analyzer-results-stable.txt" retain="/strong_analysis.*List.*argument_type_not_assignable/" replace="/-(.*?):(.*?):(.*?)-/-/g; /. â€¢ (lib|test)\/\w+\.dart:\d+:\d+//g"?>
```plaintext
error - The argument type 'List<dynamic>' can't be assigned to the parameter type 'List<int>'. - argument_type_not_assignable
```

The error highlights an unsound implicit cast from `List<dynamic>` to `List<int>`.
The `list` variable has static type `List<dynamic>`. This is because the
initializing declaration `var list = []` doesn't provide the analyzer with
enough information for it to infer a type argument more specific than `dynamic`.
The `printInts()` function expects a parameter of type `List<int>`,
causing a mismatch of types.

When adding a type annotation (`<int>`) on creation of the list
(highlighted below) the analyzer complains that
a string argument can't be assigned to an `int` parameter. 
Removing the quotes in `list.add('2')` results in code
that passes static analysis and runs with no errors or warnings.

<?code-excerpt "test/strong_test.dart (opening-example)" replace="/<int.(?=\[)|2/[!$&!]/g"?>
```dart tag=passes-sa
void printInts(List<int> a) => print(a);

void main() {
  final list = [!<int>!][];
  list.add(1);
  list.add([!2!]);
  printInts(list);
}
```

## What is soundness?

*Soundness* is about ensuring your program can't get into certain
invalid states. A sound *type system* means you can never get into
a state where an expression evaluates to a value that doesn't match
the expression's static type. For example, if an expression's static
type is `String`, at runtime you are guaranteed to only get a string
when you evaluate it.

Dart's type system, like the type systems in Java and C#, is sound. It
enforces that soundness using a combination of static checking
(compile-time errors) and runtime checks. For example, assigning a `String`
to `int` is a compile-time error. Casting an object to a `String` using
`as String` fails with a runtime error if the object isn't a `String`.


## The benefits of soundness

A sound type system has several benefits:

* Revealing type-related bugs at compile time.<br>
  A sound type system forces code to be unambiguous about its types,
  so type-related bugs that might be tricky to find at runtime are
  revealed at compile time.

* More readable code.<br>
  Code is easier to read because you can rely on a value actually having
  the specified type. In sound Dart, types can't lie.

* More maintainable code.<br>
  With a sound type system, when you change one piece of code, the
  type system can warn you about the other pieces
  of code that just broke.

* Better ahead of time (AOT) compilation.<br>
  While AOT compilation is possible without types, the generated
  code is much less efficient.


## Tips for passing static analysis

Most of the rules for static types are easy to understand.
Here are some of the less obvious rules:

* Use sound return types when overriding methods.
* Use sound parameter types when overriding methods.
* Don't use a dynamic list as a typed list.

Let's see these rules in detail, with examples that use the following
type hierarchy:

<img src="/assets/img/language/type-hierarchy.png" alt="a hierarchy of animals where the supertype is Animal and the subtypes are Alligator, Cat, and HoneyBadger. Cat has the subtypes of Lion and MaineCoon">

<a name="use-proper-return-types"></a>
### Use sound return types when overriding methods

The return type of a method in a subclass must be the same type or a
subtype of the return type of the method in the superclass. 
Consider the getter method in the `Animal` class:

<?code-excerpt "lib/animal.dart (Animal)" replace="/Animal get.*/[!$&!]/g"?>
```dart
class Animal {
  void chase(Animal a) { ... }
  [!Animal get parent => ...!]
}
```

The `parent` getter method returns an `Animal`. In the `HoneyBadger` subclass,
you can replace the getter's return type with `HoneyBadger` 
(or any other subtype of `Animal`), but an unrelated type is not allowed.

<?code-excerpt "lib/animal.dart (HoneyBadger)" replace="/(\w+)(?= get)/[!$&!]/g"?>
```dart tag=passes-sa
class HoneyBadger extends Animal {
  @override
  void chase(Animal a) { ... }

  @override
  [!HoneyBadger!] get parent => ...
}
```

<?code-excerpt "lib/animal.dart (HoneyBadger)" replace="/HoneyBadger get/[!Root!] get/g"?>
```dart tag=fails-sa
class HoneyBadger extends Animal {
  @override
  void chase(Animal a) { ... }

  @override
  [!Root!] get parent => ...
}
```

<a name="use-proper-param-types"></a>
### Use sound parameter types when overriding methods

The parameter of an overridden method must have either the same type
or a supertype of the corresponding parameter in the superclass.
Don't "tighten" the parameter type by replacing the type with a
subtype of the original parameter.

:::note
If you have a valid reason to use a subtype, you can use the
[`covariant` keyword](/guides/language/sound-problems#the-covariant-keyword).
:::

Consider the `chase(Animal)` method for the `Animal` class:

<?code-excerpt "lib/animal.dart (Animal)" replace="/void chase.*/[!$&!]/g"?>
```dart
class Animal {
  [!void chase(Animal a) { ... }!]
  Animal get parent => ...
}
```

The `chase()` method takes an `Animal`. A `HoneyBadger` chases anything.
It's OK to override the `chase()` method to take anything (`Object`).

<?code-excerpt "lib/animal.dart (chase-Object)" replace="/Object/[!$&!]/g"?>
```dart tag=passes-sa
class HoneyBadger extends Animal {
  @override
  void chase([!Object!] a) { ... }

  @override
  Animal get parent => ...
}
```

The following code tightens the parameter on the `chase()` method
from `Animal` to `Mouse`, a subclass of `Animal`.

<?code-excerpt "lib/incorrect_animal.dart (chase-mouse)" replace="/Mouse/[!$&!]/g"?>
```dart tag=fails-sa
class [!Mouse!] extends Animal { ... }

class Cat extends Animal {
  @override
  void chase([!Mouse!] a) { ... }
}
```

This code is not type safe because it would then be possible to define
a cat and send it after an alligator:

<?code-excerpt "lib/incorrect_animal.dart (would-not-be-type-safe)" replace="/Alligator/[!$&!]/g"?>
```dart
Animal a = Cat();
a.chase([!Alligator!]()); // Not type safe or feline safe.
```

### Don't use a dynamic list as a typed list

A `dynamic` list is good when you want to have a list with
different kinds of things in it. However, you can't use a
`dynamic` list as a typed list.

This rule also applies to instances of generic types.

The following code creates a `dynamic` list of `Dog`, and assigns it to
a list of type `Cat`, which generates an error during static analysis.

<?code-excerpt "lib/incorrect_animal.dart (invalid-dynamic-list)" replace="/(<dynamic\x3E)(.*?)Error/[!$1!]$2Error/g"?>
```dart tag=fails-sa
void main() {
  List<Cat> foo = [!<dynamic>!][Dog()]; // Error
  List<dynamic> bar = <dynamic>[Dog(), Cat()]; // OK
}
```

## Runtime checks

Runtime checks deal with type safety issues
that can't be detected at compile time.

For example, the following code throws an exception at runtime
because it's an error to cast a list of dogs to a list of cats:

<?code-excerpt "test/strong_test.dart (runtime-checks)" replace="/animals as[^;]*/[!$&!]/g"?>
```dart tag=runtime-fail
void main() {
  List<Animal> animals = <Dog>[Dog()];
  List<Cat> cats = [!animals as List<Cat>!];
}
```


## Type inference

The analyzer can infer types for fields, methods, local variables,
and most generic type arguments.
When the analyzer doesn't have enough information to infer
a specific type, it uses the `dynamic` type.

Here's an example of how type inference works with generics.
In this example, a variable named `arguments` holds a map that
pairs string keys with values of various types.

If you explicitly type the variable, you might write this:

<?code-excerpt "lib/strong_analysis.dart (type-inference-1-orig)" replace="/Map<String, dynamic\x3E/[!$&!]/g"?>
```dart
[!Map<String, dynamic>!] arguments = {'argA': 'hello', 'argB': 42};
```

Alternatively, you can use `var` or `final` and let Dart infer the type:

<?code-excerpt "lib/strong_analysis.dart (type-inference-1)" replace="/var/[!$&!]/g"?>
```dart
[!var!] arguments = {'argA': 'hello', 'argB': 42}; // Map<String, Object>
```

The map literal infers its type from its entries,
and then the variable infers its type from the map literal's type.
In this map, the keys are both strings, but the values have different
types (`String` and `int`, which have the upper bound `Object`).
So the map literal has the type `Map<String, Object>`,
and so does the `arguments` variable.


### Field and method inference

A field or method that has no specified type and that overrides
a field or method from the superclass, inherits the type of the
superclass method or field.

A field that does not have a declared or inherited type but that is declared
with an initial value, gets an inferred type based on the initial value.

### Static field inference

Static fields and variables get their types inferred from their
initializer. Note that inference fails if it encounters a cycle
(that is, inferring a type for the variable depends on knowing the
type of that variable).

### Local variable inference

Local variable types are inferred from their initializer, if any.
Subsequent assignments are not taken into account.
This may mean that too precise a type may be inferred.
If so, you can add a type annotation.

<?code-excerpt "lib/strong_analysis.dart (local-var-type-inference-error)"?>
```dart tag=fails-sa
var x = 3; // x is inferred as an int.
x = 4.0;
```

<?code-excerpt "lib/strong_analysis.dart (local-var-type-inference-ok)"?>
```dart tag=passes-sa
num y = 3; // A num can be double or int.
y = 4.0;
```

### Type argument inference

Type arguments to constructor calls and
[generic method](/language/generics#using-generic-methods) invocations
are inferred based on a combination of downward information from the context
of occurrence, and upward information from the arguments to the constructor
or generic method. If inference is not doing what you want or expect,
you can always explicitly specify the type arguments.

<?code-excerpt "lib/strong_analysis.dart (type-arg-inference)"?>
```dart tag=passes-sa
// Inferred as if you wrote <int>[].
List<int> listOfInt = [];

// Inferred as if you wrote <double>[3.0].
var listOfDouble = [3.0];

// Inferred as Iterable<int>.
var ints = listOfDouble.map((x) => x.toInt());
```

In the last example, `x` is inferred as `double` using downward information.
The return type of the closure is inferred as `int` using upward information.
Dart uses this return type as upward information when inferring the `map()`
method's type argument: `<int>`.


## Substituting types

When you override a method, you are replacing something of one type (in the
old method) with something that might have a new type (in the new method).
Similarly, when you pass an argument to a function,
you are replacing something that has one type (a parameter
with a declared type) with something that has another type
(the actual argument). When can you replace something that
has one type with something that has a subtype or a supertype?

When substituting types, it helps to think in terms of _consumers_
and _producers_. A consumer absorbs a type and a producer generates a type.

**You can replace a consumer's type with a supertype and a producer's
type with a subtype.**

Let's look at examples of simple type assignment and assignment with
generic types.

### Simple type assignment

When assigning objects to objects, when can you replace a type with a
different type? The answer depends on whether the object is a consumer
or a producer.

Consider the following type hierarchy:

<img src="/assets/img/language/type-hierarchy.png" alt="a hierarchy of animals where the supertype is Animal and the subtypes are Alligator, Cat, and HoneyBadger. Cat has the subtypes of Lion and MaineCoon">

Consider the following simple assignment where `Cat c` is a _consumer_
and `Cat()` is a _producer_:

<?code-excerpt "lib/strong_analysis.dart (Cat-Cat-ok)"?>
```dart
Cat c = Cat();
```

In a consuming position, it's safe to replace something that consumes a
specific type (`Cat`) with something that consumes anything (`Animal`),
so replacing `Cat c` with `Animal c` is allowed, because `Animal` is
a supertype of `Cat`.

<?code-excerpt "lib/strong_analysis.dart (Animal-Cat-ok)"?>
```dart tag=passes-sa
Animal c = Cat();
```

But replacing `Cat c` with `MaineCoon c` breaks type safety, because the
superclass may provide a type of Cat with different behaviors, such
as `Lion`:

<?code-excerpt "lib/strong_analysis.dart (MaineCoon-Cat-err)"?>
```dart tag=fails-sa
MaineCoon c = Cat();
```

In a producing position, it's safe to replace something that produces a
type (`Cat`) with a more specific type (`MaineCoon`). So, the following
is allowed:

<?code-excerpt "lib/strong_analysis.dart (Cat-MaineCoon-ok)"?>
```dart tag=passes-sa
Cat c = MaineCoon();
```

### Generic type assignment

Are the rules the same for generic types? Yes. Consider the hierarchy
of lists of animalsâ€”a `List` of `Cat` is a subtype of a `List` of
`Animal`, and a supertype of a `List` of `MaineCoon`:

<img src="/assets/img/language/type-hierarchy-generics.png" alt="List<Animal> -> List<Cat> -> List<MaineCoon>">

In the following example, 
you can assign a `MaineCoon` list to `myCats`
because `List<MaineCoon>` is a subtype of `List<Cat>`:

<?code-excerpt "lib/strong_analysis.dart (generic-type-assignment-MaineCoon)" replace="/<MaineCoon/<[!MaineCoon!]/g"?>
```dart tag=passes-sa
List<[!MaineCoon!]> myMaineCoons = ...
List<Cat> myCats = myMaineCoons;
```

What about going in the other direction? 
Can you assign an `Animal` list to a `List<Cat>`?

<?code-excerpt "lib/strong_analysis.dart (generic-type-assignment-Animal)" replace="/<Animal/<[!Animal!]/g"?>
```dart tag=fails-sa
List<[!Animal!]> myAnimals = ...
List<Cat> myCats = myAnimals;
```

This assignment doesn't pass static analysis 
because it creates an implicit downcast, 
which is disallowed from non-`dynamic` types such as `Animal`.

To make this type of code pass static analysis, 
you can use an explicit cast. 

<?code-excerpt "lib/strong_analysis.dart (generic-type-assignment-implied-cast)" replace="/as.*(?=;)/[!$&!]/g"?>
```dart
List<Animal> myAnimals = ...
List<Cat> myCats = myAnimals [!as List<Cat>!];
```

An explicit cast might still fail at runtime, though,
depending on the actual type of the list being cast (`myAnimals`).

### Methods

When overriding a method, the producer and consumer rules still apply.
For example:

<img src="/assets/img/language/consumer-producer-methods.png" alt="Animal class showing the chase method as the consumer and the parent getter as the producer">

For a consumer (such as the `chase(Animal)` method), you can replace
the parameter type with a supertype. For a producer (such as
the `parent` getter method), you can replace the return type with
a subtype.
