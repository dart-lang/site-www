<?code-excerpt plaster="none"?>

The dart:core library ([API reference][dart:core])
provides a small but critical set of built-in functionality.
This library is automatically imported into every Dart program.


## Printing to the console

The top-level `print()` method takes a single argument (any Object)
and displays that object's string value (as returned by `toString()`)
in the console.

<?code-excerpt "misc/test/library_tour/core_test.dart (print)"?>
```dart
print(anObject);
print('I drink $tea.');
```

For more information on basic strings and `toString()`, see
[Strings](/language/built-in-types#strings) in the language tour.


## Numbers

The dart:core library defines the num, int, and double classes, which
have some basic utilities for working with numbers.

You can convert a string into an integer or double with the `parse()`
methods of int and double, respectively:

<?code-excerpt "misc/test/library_tour/core_test.dart (int-double-parse)"?>
```dart
assert(int.parse('42') == 42);
assert(int.parse('0x42') == 66);
assert(double.parse('0.50') == 0.5);
```

Or use the parse() method of num, which creates an integer if possible
and otherwise a double:

<?code-excerpt "misc/test/library_tour/core_test.dart (num-parse)"?>
```dart
assert(num.parse('42') is int);
assert(num.parse('0x42') is int);
assert(num.parse('0.50') is double);
```

To specify the base of an integer, add a `radix` parameter:

<?code-excerpt "misc/test/library_tour/core_test.dart (radix)"?>
```dart
assert(int.parse('42', radix: 16) == 66);
```

Use the `toString()` method to convert an
int or double to a string. To specify the number of digits to the right
of the decimal, use [toStringAsFixed().][toStringAsFixed()] To specify the
number of significant digits in the string, use
[toStringAsPrecision():][toStringAsPrecision()]

<?code-excerpt "misc/test/library_tour/core_test.dart (to-string)"?>
```dart
// Convert an int to a string.
assert(42.toString() == '42');

// Convert a double to a string.
assert(123.456.toString() == '123.456');

// Specify the number of digits after the decimal.
assert(123.456.toStringAsFixed(2) == '123.46');

// Specify the number of significant figures.
assert(123.456.toStringAsPrecision(2) == '1.2e+2');
assert(double.parse('1.2e+2') == 120.0);
```

For more information, see the API documentation for
[int,][int] [double,][double] and [num.][num] Also see
the [dart:math section](/libraries/dart-math)

## Strings and regular expressions

A string in Dart is an immutable sequence of UTF-16 code units.
The language tour has more information about
[strings](/language/built-in-types#strings).
You can use regular expressions (RegExp objects)
to search within strings and to
replace parts of strings.

The String class defines such methods as `split()`, `contains()`,
`startsWith()`, `endsWith()`, and more.

### Searching inside a string

You can find particular locations within a string, as well as check
whether a string begins with or ends with a particular pattern. For
example:

<?code-excerpt "misc/test/library_tour/core_test.dart (contains-etc)"?>
```dart
// Check whether a string contains another string.
assert('Never odd or even'.contains('odd'));

// Does a string start with another string?
assert('Never odd or even'.startsWith('Never'));

// Does a string end with another string?
assert('Never odd or even'.endsWith('even'));

// Find the location of a string inside a string.
assert('Never odd or even'.indexOf('odd') == 6);
```

### Extracting data from a string

You can get the individual characters from a string as Strings or ints,
respectively. To be precise, you actually get individual UTF-16 code
units; high-numbered characters such as the treble clef symbol
('\\u{1D11E}') are two code units apiece.

You can also extract a substring or split a string into a list of
substrings:

<?code-excerpt "misc/test/library_tour/core_test.dart (substring-etc)"?>
```dart
// Grab a substring.
assert('Never odd or even'.substring(6, 9) == 'odd');

// Split a string using a string pattern.
var parts = 'progressive web apps'.split(' ');
assert(parts.length == 3);
assert(parts[0] == 'progressive');

// Get a UTF-16 code unit (as a string) by index.
assert('Never odd or even'[0] == 'N');

// Use split() with an empty string parameter to get
// a list of all characters (as Strings); good for
// iterating.
for (final char in 'hello'.split('')) {
  print(char);
}

// Get all the UTF-16 code units in the string.
var codeUnitList = 'Never odd or even'.codeUnits.toList();
assert(codeUnitList[0] == 78);
```

:::
In many cases, you want to work with
Unicode grapheme clusters
as opposed to pure code units.
These are characters as they are perceived
by the user (for example, "ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§" is one
user-perceived character but several
UTF-16 code units).
For this, the Dart team provides the
[`characters` package.]({{site.pub-pkg}}/characters)
:::

### Converting to uppercase or lowercase

You can easily convert strings to their uppercase and lowercase
variants:

<?code-excerpt "misc/test/library_tour/core_test.dart (case-conversions)"?>
```dart
// Convert to uppercase.
assert('web apps'.toUpperCase() == 'WEB APPS');

// Convert to lowercase.
assert('WEB APPS'.toLowerCase() == 'web apps');
```

:::note
These methods don't work for every language. For example, the Turkish
alphabet's dotless *I* is converted incorrectly.
:::


### Trimming and empty strings

Remove all leading and trailing white space with `trim()`. To check
whether a string is empty (length is zero), use `isEmpty`.

<?code-excerpt "misc/test/library_tour/core_test.dart (trim-etc)"?>
```dart
// Trim a string.
assert('  hello  '.trim() == 'hello');

// Check whether a string is empty.
assert(''.isEmpty);

// Strings with only white space are not empty.
assert('  '.isNotEmpty);
```

### Replacing part of a string

Strings are immutable objects, which means you can create them but you
can't change them. If you look closely at the [String API reference,][String]
you'll notice that
none of the methods actually changes the state of a String. For example,
the method `replaceAll()` returns a new String without changing the
original String:

<?code-excerpt "misc/test/library_tour/core_test.dart (replace)"?>
```dart
var greetingTemplate = 'Hello, NAME!';
var greeting = greetingTemplate.replaceAll(RegExp('NAME'), 'Bob');

// greetingTemplate didn't change.
assert(greeting != greetingTemplate);
```

### Building a string

To programmatically generate a string, you can use StringBuffer. A
StringBuffer doesn't generate a new String object until `toString()` is
called. The `writeAll()` method has an optional second parameter that
lets you specify a separatorâ€”in this case, a space.

<?code-excerpt "misc/test/library_tour/core_test.dart (string-buffer)"?>
```dart
var sb = StringBuffer();
sb
  ..write('Use a StringBuffer for ')
  ..writeAll(['efficient', 'string', 'creation'], ' ')
  ..write('.');

var fullString = sb.toString();

assert(fullString == 'Use a StringBuffer for efficient string creation.');
```

### Regular expressions

The RegExp class provides the same capabilities as JavaScript regular
expressions. Use regular expressions for efficient searching and pattern
matching of strings.

<?code-excerpt "misc/test/library_tour/core_test.dart (regexp)"?>
```dart
// Here's a regular expression for one or more digits.
var numbers = RegExp(r'\d+');

var allCharacters = 'llamas live fifteen to twenty years';
var someDigits = 'llamas live 15 to 20 years';

// contains() can use a regular expression.
assert(!allCharacters.contains(numbers));
assert(someDigits.contains(numbers));

// Replace every match with another string.
var exedOut = someDigits.replaceAll(numbers, 'XX');
assert(exedOut == 'llamas live XX to XX years');
```

You can work directly with the RegExp class, too. The Match class
provides access to a regular expression match.

<?code-excerpt "misc/test/library_tour/core_test.dart (match)"?>
```dart
var numbers = RegExp(r'\d+');
var someDigits = 'llamas live 15 to 20 years';

// Check whether the reg exp has a match in a string.
assert(numbers.hasMatch(someDigits));

// Loop through all matches.
for (final match in numbers.allMatches(someDigits)) {
  print(match.group(0)); // 15, then 20
}
```

### More information

Refer to the [String API reference][String] for a full list of
methods. Also see the API reference for [StringBuffer,][StringBuffer]
[Pattern,][Pattern] [RegExp,][RegExp] and [Match.][Match]

## Collections

Dart ships with a core collections API, which includes classes for
lists, sets, and maps.

:::tip
To practice using APIs that are available to both lists and sets,
follow the [Iterable collections codelab](/codelabs/iterables).
:::

### Lists

As the language tour shows, you can use literals to create and
initialize [lists](/language/collections#lists). Alternatively, use one of the List
constructors. The List class also defines several methods for adding
items to and removing items from lists.

<?code-excerpt "misc/test/library_tour/core_test.dart (list)"?>
```dart
// Create an empty list of strings.
var grains = <String>[];
assert(grains.isEmpty);

// Create a list using a list literal.
var fruits = ['apples', 'oranges'];

// Add to a list.
fruits.add('kiwis');

// Add multiple items to a list.
fruits.addAll(['grapes', 'bananas']);

// Get the list length.
assert(fruits.length == 5);

// Remove a single item.
var appleIndex = fruits.indexOf('apples');
fruits.removeAt(appleIndex);
assert(fruits.length == 4);

// Remove all elements from a list.
fruits.clear();
assert(fruits.isEmpty);

// You can also create a List using one of the constructors.
var vegetables = List.filled(99, 'broccoli');
assert(vegetables.every((v) => v == 'broccoli'));
```

Use `indexOf()` to find the index of an object in a list:

<?code-excerpt "misc/test/library_tour/core_test.dart (index-of)"?>
```dart
var fruits = ['apples', 'oranges'];

// Access a list item by index.
assert(fruits[0] == 'apples');

// Find an item in a list.
assert(fruits.indexOf('apples') == 0);
```

Sort a list using the `sort()` method. You can provide a sorting
function that compares two objects. This sorting function must return \<
0 for *smaller*, 0 for the *same*, and \> 0 for *bigger*. The following
example uses `compareTo()`, which is defined by
[Comparable][] and implemented by String.

<?code-excerpt "misc/test/library_tour/core_test.dart (compare-to)"?>
```dart
var fruits = ['bananas', 'apples', 'oranges'];

// Sort a list.
fruits.sort((a, b) => a.compareTo(b));
assert(fruits[0] == 'apples');
```

Lists are parameterized types
([generics](/language/generics)),
so you can specify the type that a list
should contain:

<?code-excerpt "misc/test/library_tour/core_test.dart (list-of-string)"?>
```dart
// This list should contain only strings.
var fruits = <String>[];

fruits.add('apples');
var fruit = fruits[0];
assert(fruit is String);
```

<?code-excerpt "misc/lib/library_tour/core/collections.dart (list-of-string)"?>
```dart tag=fails-sa
fruits.add(5); // Error: 'int' can't be assigned to 'String'
```

:::note
In many cases, you don't
need to explicitly specify generic
types, because Dart will
[infer](/language/type-system#type-inference)
them for you.
A list like `['Dash', 'Dart']` is understood
to be a `List<String>` (read: list of strings).

But there are times when you _should_ specify
the generic type. Like, for example, when Dart doesn't have
anything to infer from: `[]` could be a list of any
combination of things.
That's often not what you want, so you write `<String>[]`
or `<Person>[]` or something similar.
:::

Refer to the [List API reference][List] for a full list of methods.

### Sets

A set in Dart is an unordered collection of unique items. Because a set
is unordered, you can't get a set's items by index (position).

<?code-excerpt "misc/test/library_tour/core_test.dart (set)"?>
```dart
// Create an empty set of strings.
var ingredients = <String>{};

// Add new items to it.
ingredients.addAll(['gold', 'titanium', 'xenon']);
assert(ingredients.length == 3);

// Adding a duplicate item has no effect.
ingredients.add('gold');
assert(ingredients.length == 3);

// Remove an item from a set.
ingredients.remove('gold');
assert(ingredients.length == 2);

// You can also create sets using
// one of the constructors.
var atomicNumbers = Set.from([79, 22, 54]);
```

Use `contains()` and `containsAll()` to check whether one or more
objects are in a set:

<?code-excerpt "misc/test/library_tour/core_test.dart (contains)"?>
```dart
var ingredients = Set<String>();
ingredients.addAll(['gold', 'titanium', 'xenon']);

// Check whether an item is in the set.
assert(ingredients.contains('titanium'));

// Check whether all the items are in the set.
assert(ingredients.containsAll(['titanium', 'xenon']));
```

An intersection is a set whose items are in two other sets.

<?code-excerpt "misc/test/library_tour/core_test.dart (intersection)"?>
```dart
var ingredients = Set<String>();
ingredients.addAll(['gold', 'titanium', 'xenon']);

// Create the intersection of two sets.
var nobleGases = Set.from(['xenon', 'argon']);
var intersection = ingredients.intersection(nobleGases);
assert(intersection.length == 1);
assert(intersection.contains('xenon'));
```

Refer to the [Set API reference][Set] for a full list of methods.

### Maps

A map, commonly known as a *dictionary* or *hash*, is an unordered
collection of key-value pairs. Maps associate a key to some value for
easy retrieval. Unlike in JavaScript, Dart objects are not maps.

You can declare a map using a terse literal syntax, or you can use a
traditional constructor:

<?code-excerpt "misc/test/library_tour/core_test.dart (map)"?>
```dart
// Maps often use strings as keys.
var hawaiianBeaches = {
  'Oahu': ['Waikiki', 'Kailua', 'Waimanalo'],
  'Big Island': ['Wailea Bay', 'Pololu Beach'],
  'Kauai': ['Hanalei', 'Poipu']
};

// Maps can be built from a constructor.
var searchTerms = Map();

// Maps are parameterized types; you can specify what
// types the key and value should be.
var nobleGases = Map<int, String>();
```

You add, get, and set map items using the bracket syntax. Use `remove()`
to remove a key and its value from a map.

<?code-excerpt "misc/test/library_tour/core_test.dart (remove)"?>
```dart
var nobleGases = {54: 'xenon'};

// Retrieve a value with a key.
assert(nobleGases[54] == 'xenon');

// Check whether a map contains a key.
assert(nobleGases.containsKey(54));

// Remove a key and its value.
nobleGases.remove(54);
assert(!nobleGases.containsKey(54));
```

You can retrieve all the values or all the keys from a map:

<?code-excerpt "misc/test/library_tour/core_test.dart (keys)"?>
```dart
var hawaiianBeaches = {
  'Oahu': ['Waikiki', 'Kailua', 'Waimanalo'],
  'Big Island': ['Wailea Bay', 'Pololu Beach'],
  'Kauai': ['Hanalei', 'Poipu']
};

// Get all the keys as an unordered collection
// (an Iterable).
var keys = hawaiianBeaches.keys;

assert(keys.length == 3);
assert(Set.from(keys).contains('Oahu'));

// Get all the values as an unordered collection
// (an Iterable of Lists).
var values = hawaiianBeaches.values;
assert(values.length == 3);
assert(values.any((v) => v.contains('Waikiki')));
```

To check whether a map contains a key, use `containsKey()`. Because map
values can be null, you cannot rely on simply getting the value for the
key and checking for null to determine the existence of a key.

<?code-excerpt "misc/test/library_tour/core_test.dart (contains-key)"?>
```dart
var hawaiianBeaches = {
  'Oahu': ['Waikiki', 'Kailua', 'Waimanalo'],
  'Big Island': ['Wailea Bay', 'Pololu Beach'],
  'Kauai': ['Hanalei', 'Poipu']
};

assert(hawaiianBeaches.containsKey('Oahu'));
assert(!hawaiianBeaches.containsKey('Florida'));
```

Use the `putIfAbsent()` method when you want to assign a value to a key
if and only if the key does not already exist in a map. You must provide
a function that returns the value.

<?code-excerpt "misc/test/library_tour/core_test.dart (put-if-absent)"?>
```dart
var teamAssignments = <String, String>{};
teamAssignments.putIfAbsent('Catcher', () => pickToughestKid());
assert(teamAssignments['Catcher'] != null);
```

Refer to the [Map API reference][Map] for a full list of methods.

### Common collection methods

List, Set, and Map share common functionality found in many collections.
Some of this common functionality is defined by the Iterable class,
which List and Set implement.

:::note
  Although Map doesn't implement Iterable, you can get Iterables from it using
  the Map `keys` and `values` properties.
:::

Use `isEmpty` or `isNotEmpty` to check whether a list, set, or map has items:

<?code-excerpt "misc/test/library_tour/core_test.dart (is-empty)"?>
```dart
var coffees = <String>[];
var teas = ['green', 'black', 'chamomile', 'earl grey'];
assert(coffees.isEmpty);
assert(teas.isNotEmpty);
```

To apply a function to each item in a list, set, or map, you can use
`forEach()`:

<?code-excerpt "misc/test/library_tour/core_test.dart (list-for-each)"?>
```dart
var teas = ['green', 'black', 'chamomile', 'earl grey'];

teas.forEach((tea) => print('I drink $tea'));
```

When you invoke `forEach()` on a map, your function must take two
arguments (the key and value):

<?code-excerpt "misc/test/library_tour/core_test.dart (map-for-each)"?>
```dart
hawaiianBeaches.forEach((k, v) {
  print('I want to visit $k and swim at $v');
  // I want to visit Oahu and swim at
  // [Waikiki, Kailua, Waimanalo], etc.
});
```

Iterables provide the `map()` method, which gives you all the results in
a single object:

<?code-excerpt "misc/test/library_tour/core_test.dart (list-map)"?>
```dart
var teas = ['green', 'black', 'chamomile', 'earl grey'];

var loudTeas = teas.map((tea) => tea.toUpperCase());
loudTeas.forEach(print);
```

:::note
The object returned by `map()` is an Iterable that's *lazily evaluated*: your
function isn't called until you ask for an item from the returned object.
:::

To force your function to be called immediately on each item, use
`map().toList()` or `map().toSet()`:

<?code-excerpt "misc/test/library_tour/core_test.dart (to-list)"?>
```dart
var loudTeas = teas.map((tea) => tea.toUpperCase()).toList();
```

Use Iterable's `where()` method to get all the items that match a
condition. Use Iterable's `any()` and `every()` methods to check whether
some or all items match a condition.
{% comment %}
PENDING: Change example as suggested by floitsch to have (maybe)
cities instead of isDecaffeinated.
{% endcomment %}


<?code-excerpt "misc/test/library_tour/core_test.dart (where-etc)"?>
```dart
var teas = ['green', 'black', 'chamomile', 'earl grey'];

// Chamomile is not caffeinated.
bool isDecaffeinated(String teaName) => teaName == 'chamomile';

// Use where() to find only the items that return true
// from the provided function.
var decaffeinatedTeas = teas.where((tea) => isDecaffeinated(tea));
// or teas.where(isDecaffeinated)

// Use any() to check whether at least one item in the
// collection satisfies a condition.
assert(teas.any(isDecaffeinated));

// Use every() to check whether all the items in a
// collection satisfy a condition.
assert(!teas.every(isDecaffeinated));
```

For a full list of methods, refer to the [Iterable API reference,][Iterable]
as well as those for [List,][List] [Set,][Set] and [Map.][Map]


## URIs

The [Uri class][Uri] provides
functions to encode and decode strings for use in URIs (which you might
know as *URLs*). These functions handle characters that are special for
URIs, such as `&` and `=`. The Uri class also parses and exposes the
components of a URIâ€”host, port, scheme, and so on.
{% comment %}
{PENDING: show
constructors: Uri.http, Uri.https, Uri.file, per floitsch's suggestion}
{% endcomment %}

### Encoding and decoding fully qualified URIs

To encode and decode characters *except* those with special meaning in a
URI (such as `/`, `:`, `&`, `#`), use the `encodeFull()` and
`decodeFull()` methods. These methods are good for encoding or decoding
a fully qualified URI, leaving intact special URI characters.

<?code-excerpt "misc/test/library_tour/core_test.dart (encode-full)"?>
```dart
var uri = 'https://example.org/api?foo=some message';

var encoded = Uri.encodeFull(uri);
assert(encoded == 'https://example.org/api?foo=some%20message');

var decoded = Uri.decodeFull(encoded);
assert(uri == decoded);
```

Notice how only the space between `some` and `message` was encoded.

### Encoding and decoding URI components

To encode and decode all of a string's characters that have special
meaning in a URI, including (but not limited to) `/`, `&`, and `:`, use
the `encodeComponent()` and `decodeComponent()` methods.

<?code-excerpt "misc/test/library_tour/core_test.dart (encode-component)"?>
```dart
var uri = 'https://example.org/api?foo=some message';

var encoded = Uri.encodeComponent(uri);
assert(
    encoded == 'https%3A%2F%2Fexample.org%2Fapi%3Ffoo%3Dsome%20message');

var decoded = Uri.decodeComponent(encoded);
assert(uri == decoded);
```

Notice how every special character is encoded. For example, `/` is
encoded to `%2F`.

### Parsing URIs

If you have a Uri object or a URI string, you can get its parts using
Uri fields such as `path`. To create a Uri from a string, use the
`parse()` static method:

<?code-excerpt "misc/test/library_tour/core_test.dart (uri-parse)"?>
```dart
var uri = Uri.parse('https://example.org:8080/foo/bar#frag');

assert(uri.scheme == 'https');
assert(uri.host == 'example.org');
assert(uri.path == '/foo/bar');
assert(uri.fragment == 'frag');
assert(uri.origin == 'https://example.org:8080');
```

See the [Uri API reference][Uri] for more URI components that you can get.

### Building URIs

You can build up a URI from individual parts using the `Uri()`
constructor:

<?code-excerpt "misc/test/library_tour/core_test.dart (uri)"?>
```dart
var uri = Uri(
    scheme: 'https',
    host: 'example.org',
    path: '/foo/bar',
    fragment: 'frag',
    queryParameters: {'lang': 'dart'});
assert(uri.toString() == 'https://example.org/foo/bar?lang=dart#frag');
```

If you don't need to specify a fragment,
to create a URI with a http or https scheme,
you can instead use the [`Uri.http`][] or [`Uri.https`][] factory constructors:

<?code-excerpt "misc/test/library_tour/core_test.dart (uri-http)"?>
```dart
var httpUri = Uri.http('example.org', '/foo/bar', {'lang': 'dart'});
var httpsUri = Uri.https('example.org', '/foo/bar', {'lang': 'dart'});

assert(httpUri.toString() == 'http://example.org/foo/bar?lang=dart');
assert(httpsUri.toString() == 'https://example.org/foo/bar?lang=dart');
```

[`Uri.http`]: {{site.dart-api}}/{{site.sdkInfo.channel}}/dart-core/Uri/Uri.http.html
[`Uri.https`]: {{site.dart-api}}/{{site.sdkInfo.channel}}/dart-core/Uri/Uri.https.html

## Dates and times

A DateTime object is a point in time. The time zone is either UTC or the
local time zone.

You can create DateTime objects using several constructors and methods:

<?code-excerpt "misc/test/library_tour/core_test.dart (date-time)"?>
```dart
// Get the current date and time.
var now = DateTime.now();

// Create a new DateTime with the local time zone.
var y2k = DateTime(2000); // January 1, 2000

// Specify the month and day.
y2k = DateTime(2000, 1, 2); // January 2, 2000

// Specify the date as a UTC time.
y2k = DateTime.utc(2000); // 1/1/2000, UTC

// Specify a date and time in ms since the Unix epoch.
y2k = DateTime.fromMillisecondsSinceEpoch(946684800000, isUtc: true);

// Parse an ISO 8601 date in the UTC time zone.
y2k = DateTime.parse('2000-01-01T00:00:00Z');

// Create a new DateTime from an existing one, adjusting just some properties:
var sameTimeLastYear = now.copyWith(year: now.year - 1);
```

:::warning
`DateTime` operations might give unexpected results related to
Daylight Savings Time and other non-standard time adjustments.  
:::

The `millisecondsSinceEpoch` property of a date returns the number of
milliseconds since the "Unix epoch"â€”January 1, 1970, UTC:

<?code-excerpt "misc/test/library_tour/core_test.dart (milliseconds-since-epoch)"?>
```dart
// 1/1/2000, UTC
var y2k = DateTime.utc(2000);
assert(y2k.millisecondsSinceEpoch == 946684800000);

// 1/1/1970, UTC
var unixEpoch = DateTime.utc(1970);
assert(unixEpoch.millisecondsSinceEpoch == 0);
```

Use the Duration class to calculate the difference between two dates and
to shift a date forward or backward:

<?code-excerpt "misc/test/library_tour/core_test.dart (duration)"?>
```dart
var y2k = DateTime.utc(2000);

// Add one year.
var y2001 = y2k.add(const Duration(days: 366));
assert(y2001.year == 2001);

// Subtract 30 days.
var december2000 = y2001.subtract(const Duration(days: 30));
assert(december2000.year == 2000);
assert(december2000.month == 12);

// Calculate the difference between two dates.
// Returns a Duration object.
var duration = y2001.difference(y2k);
assert(duration.inDays == 366); // y2k was a leap year.
```

:::warning
Using a `Duration` to shift a `DateTime` by days can be problematic, due to
clock shifts (to daylight saving time, for example).
Use UTC dates if you must shift days.

For a full list of methods,
refer to the API reference for [DateTime][] and [Duration.][Duration]


## Utility classes

The core library contains various utility classes, useful for sorting,
mapping values, and iterating.

### Comparing objects

Implement the [Comparable][]
interface to indicate that an object can be compared to another object,
usually for sorting. The `compareTo()` method returns \< 0 for
*smaller*, 0 for the *same*, and \> 0 for *bigger*.

<?code-excerpt "misc/lib/library_tour/core/comparable.dart"?>
```dart
class Line implements Comparable<Line> {
  final int length;
  const Line(this.length);

  @override
  int compareTo(Line other) => length - other.length;
}

void main() {
  var short = const Line(1);
  var long = const Line(100);
  assert(short.compareTo(long) < 0);
}
```

### Implementing map keys

Each object in Dart automatically provides an integer hash code, and
thus can be used as a key in a map. However, you can override the
`hashCode` getter to generate a custom hash code. If you do, you might
also want to override the `==` operator. Objects that are equal (via
`==`) must have identical hash codes. A hash code doesn't have to be
unique, but it should be well distributed.

:::tip
To consistently and easily implement the `hashCode` getter,
consider using the static hashing methods provided by the `Object` class.

To generate a single hash code for multiple properties of an object,
you can use [`Object.hash()`][].
To generate a hash code for a collection,
you can use either [`Object.hashAll()`][] (if element order matters)
or [`Object.hashAllUnordered()`][].

[`Object.hashAll()`]: {{site.dart-api}}/{{site.sdkInfo.channel}}/dart-core/Object/hashAll.html
[`Object.hashAllUnordered()`]: {{site.dart-api}}/{{site.sdkInfo.channel}}/dart-core/Object/hashAllUnordered.html

{% comment %}
Note: There's disagreement over whether to include identical() in the ==
implementation. It might improve speed, at least when you need to
compare many fields. They don't do identical() automatically because, by
convention, NaN != NaN.
{% endcomment %}

<?code-excerpt "misc/lib/library_tour/core/hash_code.dart"?>
```dart
class Person {
  final String firstName, lastName;

  Person(this.firstName, this.lastName);

  // Override hashCode using the static hashing methods
  // provided by the `Object` class.
  @override
  int get hashCode => Object.hash(firstName, lastName);

  // You should generally implement operator `==` if you
  // override `hashCode`.
  @override
  bool operator ==(Object other) {
    return other is Person &&
        other.firstName == firstName &&
        other.lastName == lastName;
  }
}

void main() {
  var p1 = Person('Bob', 'Smith');
  var p2 = Person('Bob', 'Smith');
  var p3 = 'not a person';
  assert(p1.hashCode == p2.hashCode);
  assert(p1 == p2);
  assert(p1 != p3);
}
```

### Iteration

The [Iterable][] and [Iterator][] classes
support sequential access to a collection of values.
To practice using these collections,
follow the [Iterable collections codelab](/codelabs/iterables).

If you create a class that can provide Iterators for use in for-in loops,
extend (if possible) or implement Iterable.
Implement Iterator to define the actual iteration ability.

<?code-excerpt "misc/lib/library_tour/core/iterator.dart"?>
```dart
class Process {
  // Represents a process...
}

class ProcessIterator implements Iterator<Process> {
  @override
  Process get current => ...
  @override
  bool moveNext() => ...
}

// A mythical class that lets you iterate through all
// processes. Extends a subclass of [Iterable].
class Processes extends IterableBase<Process> {
  @override
  final Iterator<Process> iterator = ProcessIterator();
}

void main() {
  // Iterable objects can be used with for-in.
  for (final process in Processes()) {
    // Do something with the process.
  }
}
```

## Exceptions

The Dart core library defines many common exceptions and errors.
Exceptions are considered conditions that you can plan ahead for and
catch. Errors are conditions that you don't expect or plan for.

A couple of the most common errors are:

[NoSuchMethodError][]

:   Thrown when a receiving object (which might be null) does not
    implement a method.

[ArgumentError][]

:   Can be thrown by a method that encounters an unexpected argument.

Throwing an application-specific exception is a common way to indicate
that an error has occurred. You can define a custom exception by
implementing the Exception interface:

<?code-excerpt "misc/lib/library_tour/core/exception.dart"?>
```dart
class FooException implements Exception {
  final String? msg;

  const FooException([this.msg]);

  @override
  String toString() => msg ?? 'FooException';
}
```

For more information, see
[Exceptions](/language/error-handling#exceptions)
(in the language tour) and the [Exception API reference.][Exception]

## Weak references and finalizers

Dart is a [garbage-collected][] language,
which means that any Dart object
that isn't referenced
can be disposed by the garbage collector.
This default behavior might not be desirable in
some scenarios involving native resources or
if the target object can't be modified.

A [WeakReference][]
stores a reference to the target object
that does not affect how it is
collected by the garbage collector.
Another option is to use an [Expando][]
to add properties to an object.

A [Finalizer][] can be used to execute a callback function
after an object is no longer referenced.
However, it is not guaranteed to execute this callback.

A [NativeFinalizer][]
provides stronger guarantees
for interacting with native code using [dart:ffi][];
its callback is invoked at least once
after the object is no longer referenced.
Also, it can be used to close native resources
such as a database connection or open files.

To ensure that an object won't be
garbage collected and finalized too early,
classes can implement the [Finalizable][] interface.
When a local variable is Finalizable,
it won't be garbage collected
until the code block where it is declared has exited.

:::version-note
Support for weak references and finalizers was added in Dart 2.17.
