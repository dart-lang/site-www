## Flutter

The popular [Flutter toolkit][] is powered by the
Dart language, runtimes, tooling, and libraries.
Over _one million_ Flutter apps for Android,
iOS, the web, and other targets, are all Dart-based.

The [Flutter showcase][] features popular Flutter apps, including:

* [BMW][]
    > "The BMW Group is establishing itself as a leading automotive app developer
    and provider with a Flutter architecture developed 100% in-house."
* [Sonos][]: 
    > "...If setup is the “grand entryway” to the Sonos ecosystem, Flutter forms
    its elegant façade..."
* [Alibaba][]: 
    > "When the Xianyu team was challenged to improve their user experience by
    developing an app that was consistent across platforms, had beautiful graphics,
    and still loaded fast, they turned to Flutter."
* [PUBG][]: 
    > "When the PUBG MOBILE team wanted to add a community module to allow players
    from all over the world to share gameplay clips and more, they turned to Flutter."

## Google 

Dart is used in almost every product group at Google:

* The [Google Play Console][] lets app publishers market Android apps, and
  is written completely in Dart.
* The [Google Ads][] team continues to grow, with hundreds of SWEs primarily
  writing Dart code.
* The [Google Assistant][] team uses Flutter and Dart to
  drive the overall system UI of their Smart Displays.
* Both the UI and much of the back-end code for the
  [Google Nest Hub][] and Hub Max devices are written in Dart.
* The list goes on, with many more Google applications
  made using Dart and Flutter:

  * [Google Pay][]
  * [Google One][]
  * [Google Fibre][]
  * [Google Elections][]
  * [Google Shopping][]
  * [Cloud Search][]
  * [Family Link][]
  * [Google One][]
  * [Cloud Search][] 

Several other Google teams are currently rewriting their projects in Flutter.
In all, Google has thousands of developers
writing millions of lines of code in Dart.
