### Docs updated or added to dart.dev {:.no_toc}

In preparation for Dart 3, we split up and reorganized the
Language Tour into new conceptual categories.
You can access the restructured language documentation
under **Language** in the side navigation menu, or by
visiting the updated [Introduction to Dart][].

Taking advantage of this new structure,
we added documentation for each of Dart 3's major features:

- [Pattern matching][] and the different [types of patterns][].
- [Switch expressions][] with support for
  patterns and [exhaustiveness checking][].
- [If statements with case clauses][] to support pattern matching.
- [Records][], a new anonymous, immutable, and aggregate type
  that enables [multiple returns][].
- [Class modifiers][] that give libraries more control over exported types.

To help you transition to Dart 3's enforcement of [sound null safety][]
and other changes, we also prepared the following updates:

- Created a comprehensive [Dart 3 migration guide][].
- Migrated all documentation and code examples
  to Dart 3, the latest tool releases, and the latest dependencies.
- Clarified that Dart's type system is now always null-safe in Dart 3.
- Updated and reorganized the [Language evolution][] page
  and its [language versioning][] discussion.
- Removed remnants of Dart 1 and early Dart 2 docs, notes, and resources.

In addition to the new Dart 3 content and 
corresponding updates across the site,
we made the following changes:

- Added a guide on configuring [compilation environment declarations][].
- Continued Dart's native interoperability work
  by adding a guide on experimental support for [Java interop][].
- Clarified the usage and limitations of [unnamed extensions][].
- Added a page for the new [`dart info`][] command 
  that helps with tooling diagnostics.
- Overhauled the [`dart pub add`][] documentation
  to cover its new [source descriptor][] syntax.
- Surfaced preview Linux RISC-V (RV64GC) builds on the
  beta channel in the [SDK archive][].
- Began a new site-wide [glossary][] to contain 
  common terms used throughout the site.
- Highlighted experimental work on Dart's [JS static interop support][].
- Documented the existence and current limitations of [analyzer plugins][].

### Docs updated or added to dart.dev {:.no_toc}

In addition to bug fixes and small improvements,
we made the following changes to this site:

* Added a [`dart` tool page][dart-tool]
  to document the new command-line interface to the Dart SDK.
  The new `dart` tool is analogous to the `flutter` tool in the Flutter SDK.
  Previously, the `dart` command only ran command-line apps.
  We updated the previous `dart` page accordingly
  and plan to update references to other tools over time.
* Updated the [package changelog documentation][changelog-docs]
  to recommend a standard format for `CHANGELOG.md` files.
  This new format lets tools
  (such as the relaunched pub.dev)
  parse changelogs.
* Changed an [Effective Dart][] guideline to favor
  using `Object` instead of `dynamic`.
  For details, see the revised guideline
  [AVOID using `dynamic` unless you want to disable static checking.][dynamic]
* Updated the [diagnostic messages page][diagnostics] to
  include more messages produced by the Dart analyzer.
* Updated the [evolution page][evolution]
  to include 2.9 and 2.10.
* Reorganized the [language specification page][spec]
  to make it easier to find the PDF version of
  the latest, in-progress specification.
* Added or updated docs related to [sound null safety][],
  a feature that's coming to the Dart language:
  * Clarified how to use [experiment flags with IDEs][experiments].
  * Updated the null safety page, adding information about
    [how to enable null safety][ns-enable].
  * Added a deep dive into null safety,
    [Understanding null safety][],
    written by Dart engineer Bob Nystrom.

### Articles added to the Dart blog {:.no_toc}
