  Learn about using compilation environment declarations 
  to customize application behavior.
---

You can specify compilation environment declarations
when building or running a Dart application.
Compilation environment declarations specify
configuration options as key-value pairs
that are accessed and evaluated at compile time.

:::note
This page uses "environment" to refer
to the Dart compilation environment. 
The common use of the term instead refers
to the operating system environment.
:::

Your app can use the values of environment declarations
to change its functionality or behavior.
Dart compilers can eliminate the code made unreachable
due to control flow using the environment declaration values.

You might define and use environment declarations to:

* Add functionality during debugging, such as enabling logging.
* Create separate flavors of your application.
* Configure application behavior, such as the port of an HTTP server.
* Enable an experimental mode of your application for testing.
* Switch between testing and production backends.

To specify an environment declaration
when running or compiling a Dart application,
use the `--define` option or its abbreviation, `-D`.
Specify the declaration key-value pair
using a `<NAME>=<VALUE>` format:

```console
$ dart run --define=DEBUG=true -DFLAVOR=free
```

To learn how to set these declarations with other tools, 
check out the [specifying environment declarations][] section in this guide.
That section explains the declaration syntax and
how to specify them on the command line and in IDEs and editors.

## Accessing environment declarations

To access specified environment declaration values,
use one of the `fromEnvironment` constructors
with `const` or within a constant context.
Use [`bool.fromEnvironment`][bool-from] for `true` or `false` values,
[`int.fromEnvironment`][int-from] for integer values,
and [`String.fromEnvironment`][string-from] for anything else.

:::note
The environment declaration constructors are only guaranteed
to work when invoked as `const`.
Most compilers must be able to evaluate their value at compile time.
:::

Each of the `fromEnvironment` constructors require the
name or key of the environment declaration.
They also accept an optional `defaultValue` named argument
to override the default fallback value.
The default fallback value is used when a declaration isn't defined
or the specified value cannot be parsed as the expected type.

For example, if you want to print log messages
only when the environment declaration `DEBUG` is set to `true`:

<?code-excerpt "misc/lib/development/environment_declarations.dart (debug-log)"?>
```dart
void log(String message) {
  // Log the debug message if the environment declaration 'DEBUG' is `true`.
  // If there was no value specified, do not log.
  if (const bool.fromEnvironment('DEBUG', defaultValue: false)) {
    print('Debug: $message');
  }
}
```

In this snippet, if `DEBUG` is set to `false`
during compilation, or not specified at all,
production compilers can completely remove the condition and its body.

The `fromEnvironment` constructors fallback to 
a default value when the declaration isn't specified or
the specified value cannot be parsed.
Therefore, to specifically check whether
an environment declaration has been specified,
use the [`bool.hasEnvironment`][bool-has] constructor:

<?code-excerpt "misc/lib/development/environment_declarations.dart (has-debug)"?>
```dart
if (const bool.hasEnvironment('DEBUG')) {
  print('Debug behavior was configured!');
}
```

## Specifying environment declarations

:::warning
Dart tools and compilers currently do not
consistently handle environment declarations
with comma-separated values.
To track standardization of this handling,
reference [SDK issue 44995][].

### Dart CLI

Both `dart run` and the `dart compile` subcommands accept
any number of the `-D` or `--define` options
to specify environment declaration values.

```console
$ dart run --define=DEBUG=true -DFLAVOR=free main.dart
$ dart compile exe --define=DEBUG=true -DFLAVOR=free main.dart
$ dart compile js --define=DEBUG=true -DFLAVOR=free main.dart
$ dart compile aot-snapshot --define=DEBUG=true -DFLAVOR=free main.dart
$ dart compile jit-snapshot --define=DEBUG=true -DFLAVOR=free main.dart
$ dart compile kernel --define=DEBUG=true -DFLAVOR=free main.dart
```

#### `webdev`

To learn about configuring `webdev` to pass environment declarations
to both the development and production web compilers,
check out [the `webdev` configuration documentation][webdev-config].

[webdev-config]: {{site.pub-pkg}}/build_web_compilers#configuring--d-environment-variables

### Visual Studio Code

In your launch configuration (`launch.json`) under `configurations`,
add a new `toolArgs` key containing the your desired environment declarations:

```json
"configurations": [
    {
        "name": "Dart",
        "request": "launch",
        "type": "dart",
        "toolArgs": [
          "--define=DEBUG=true"
        ]
    }
]
```

To learn more, check out the documentation for
[VS Code launch configurations.][VSC instructions]

[VSC instructions]: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging#_launch-configurations

### JetBrains IDEs

In the **Run/Debug Configurations** for your project,
add your desired environment declarations to **VM options**:

To learn more, check out JetBrains' documentation for
[Dart Run/Debug Configurations][jetbrains-run-debug].

### Flutter

To specify environment declarations to the Flutter tool,
use the `--dart-define` option instead:

```console
$ flutter run --dart-define=DEBUG=true
```
