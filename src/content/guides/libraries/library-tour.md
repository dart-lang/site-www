  !! NOTE:
  
  All new library content should go within the `/library` directory.
  This file exists temporarily for legacy reasons so
  links to the old library tour do not break.
  
  In the short term, if you move content that is referenced here,
  update the text and link in this file, as well as
  the redirection map in `src/assets/js/library-tour-redirector.js`.
