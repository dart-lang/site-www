# Effective Dart writing guidelines

## TOC

If you add a guideline or update the header of one,
you will need to regenerate the table of contents
found at [Summary of all rules][]
and commit the resulting generated file.

To do so, run the following from the repository root directory:

```console
$ dart run tool/effective_dart_rules/bin/main.dart
```

[Summary of all rules]: https://dart.dev/effective-dart#summary-of-all-rules
