<?code-excerpt path-base="misc/lib/effective_dart"?>

You can use these guidelines every day in the bodies of your Dart code. *Users*
of your library may not be able to tell that you've internalized the ideas here,
but *maintainers* of it sure will.

## Libraries

These guidelines help you compose your program out of multiple files in a
consistent, maintainable way. To keep these guidelines brief, they use "import"
to cover `import` and `export` directives. The guidelines apply equally to both. 

### DO use strings in `part of` directives

{% include 'linter-rule-mention.md', rules:'use_string_in_part_of_directives' %}

Many Dart developers avoid using `part` entirely. They find it easier to reason
about their code when each library is a single file. If you do choose to use
`part` to split part of a library out into another file, Dart requires the other
file to in turn indicate which library it's a part of. 

Dart allows the `part of` directive to use the *name* of a library.
Naming libraries is a legacy feature that is now [discouraged][]. 
Library names can introduce ambiguity
when determining which library a part belongs to.

[discouraged]: /effective-dart/style#dont-explicitly-name-libraries

The preferred syntax is to use a URI string that points
directly to the library file. 
If you have some library, `my_library.dart`, that contains:

<?code-excerpt "my_library.dart"?>
```dart title="my_library.dart"
library my_library;

part 'some/other/file.dart';
```

Then the part file should use the library file's URI string:

<?code-excerpt "some/other/file.dart"?>
```dart tag=good
part of '../../my_library.dart';
```

Not the library name:

<?code-excerpt "some/other/file_2.dart"?>
```dart tag=bad
part of my_library;
```

### DON'T import libraries that are inside the `src` directory of another package

{% include 'linter-rule-mention.md', rules:'implementation_imports' %}

The `src` directory under `lib` [is specified][package guide] to contain
libraries private to the package's own implementation. The way package
maintainers version their package takes this convention into account. They are
free to make sweeping changes to code under `src` without it being a breaking
change to the package.

[package guide]: /tools/pub/package-layout

That means that if you import some other package's private library, a minor,
theoretically non-breaking point release of that package could break your code.


### DON'T allow an import path to reach into or out of `lib`

{% include 'linter-rule-mention.md', rules:'avoid_relative_lib_imports' %}

A `package:` import lets you access
a library inside a package's `lib` directory
without having to worry about where the package is stored on your computer.
For this to work, you cannot have imports that require the `lib`
to be in some location on disk relative to other files.
In other words, a relative import path in a file inside `lib`
can't reach out and access a file outside of the `lib` directory,
and a library outside of `lib` can't use a relative path
to reach into the `lib` directory.
Doing either leads to confusing errors and broken programs.

For example, say your directory structure looks like this:

```plaintext
my_package
└─ lib
   └─ api.dart
   test
   └─ api_test.dart
```

And say `api_test.dart` imports `api.dart` in two ways:

```dart title="api_test.dart" tag=bad
import 'package:my_package/api.dart';
import '../lib/api.dart';
```

Dart thinks those are imports of two completely unrelated libraries.
To avoid confusing Dart and yourself, follow these two rules:

* Don't use `/lib/` in import paths.
* Don't use `../` to escape the `lib` directory.

Instead, when you need to reach into a package's `lib` directory
(even from the same package's `test` directory
or any other top-level directory),
use a `package:` import.

```dart title="api_test.dart" tag=good
import 'package:my_package/api.dart';
```

A package should never reach *out* of its `lib` directory and
import libraries from other places in the package.


### PREFER relative import paths

{% include 'linter-rule-mention.md', rules:'prefer_relative_imports' %}

Whenever the previous rule doesn't come into play, follow this one.
When an import does *not* reach across `lib`, prefer using relative imports.
They're shorter.
For example, say your directory structure looks like this:

```plaintext
my_package
└─ lib
   ├─ src
   │  └─ stuff.dart
   │  └─ utils.dart
   └─ api.dart
   test
   │─ api_test.dart
   └─ test_utils.dart
```

Here is how the various libraries should import each other:

```dart title="lib/api.dart" tag=good
import 'src/stuff.dart';
import 'src/utils.dart';
```

```dart title="lib/src/utils.dart" tag=good
import '../api.dart';
import 'stuff.dart';
```

```dart title="test/api_test.dart" tag=good
import 'package:my_package/api.dart'; // Don't reach into 'lib'.

import 'test_utils.dart'; // Relative within 'test' is fine.
```


## Null


### DON'T explicitly initialize variables to `null`

{% include 'linter-rule-mention.md', rules:'avoid_init_to_null' %}

If a variable has a non-nullable type, Dart reports a compile error if you try
to use it before it has been definitely initialized. If the variable is
nullable, then it is implicitly initialized to `null` for you. There's no
concept of "uninitialized memory" in Dart and no need to explicitly initialize a
variable to `null` to be "safe".

<?code-excerpt "usage_good.dart (no-null-init)"?>
```dart tag=good
Item? bestDeal(List<Item> cart) {
  Item? bestItem;

  for (final item in cart) {
    if (bestItem == null || item.price < bestItem.price) {
      bestItem = item;
    }
  }

  return bestItem;
}
```

<?code-excerpt "usage_bad.dart (no-null-init)" replace="/ = null/[!$&!]/g"?>
```dart tag=bad
Item? bestDeal(List<Item> cart) {
  Item? bestItem[! = null!];

  for (final item in cart) {
    if (bestItem == null || item.price < bestItem.price) {
      bestItem = item;
    }
  }

  return bestItem;
}
```


### DON'T use an explicit default value of `null`

{% include 'linter-rule-mention.md', rules:'avoid_init_to_null' %}

If you make a nullable parameter optional but don't give it a default value, the
language implicitly uses `null` as the default, so there's no need to write it.

<?code-excerpt "usage_good.dart (default-value-null)"?>
```dart tag=good
void error([String? message]) {
  stderr.write(message ?? '\n');
}
```

<?code-excerpt "usage_bad.dart (default-value-null)"?>
```dart tag=bad
void error([String? message = null]) {
  stderr.write(message ?? '\n');
}
```

<a id="prefer-using--to-convert-null-to-a-boolean-value"></a>
### DON'T use `true` or `false` in equality operations

Using the equality operator to evaluate a *non-nullable* boolean expression 
against a boolean literal is redundant. 
It's always simpler to eliminate the equality operator, 
and use the unary negation operator `!` if necessary:

<?code-excerpt "usage_good.dart (non-null-boolean-expression)"?>
```dart tag=good
if (nonNullableBool) { ... }

if (!nonNullableBool) { ... }
```

<?code-excerpt "usage_bad.dart (non-null-boolean-expression)"?>
```dart tag=bad
if (nonNullableBool == true) { ... }

if (nonNullableBool == false) { ... }
```

To evaluate a boolean expression that *is nullable*, you should use `??`
or an explicit `!= null` check.

<?code-excerpt "usage_good.dart (nullable-boolean-expression)"?>
```dart tag=good
// If you want null to result in false:
if (nullableBool ?? false) { ... }

// If you want null to result in false
// and you want the variable to type promote:
if (nullableBool != null && nullableBool) { ... }
```

<?code-excerpt "usage_bad.dart (nullable-boolean-expression)"?>
```dart tag=bad
// Static error if null:
if (nullableBool) { ... }

// If you want null to be false:
if (nullableBool == true) { ... }
```

`nullableBool == true` is a viable expression, 
but shouldn't be used for several reasons:

* It doesn't indicate the code has anything to do with `null`.

* Because it's not evidently `null` related, 
  it can easily be mistaken for the non-nullable case,
  where the equality operator is redundant and can be removed.
  That's only true when the boolean expression on the left
  has no chance of producing null, but not when it can.

* The boolean logic is confusing. If `nullableBool` is null, 
  then `nullableBool == true` means the condition evaluates to `false`.

The `??` operator makes it clear that something to do with null is happening,
so it won't be mistaken for a redundant operation. 
The logic is much clearer too; 
the result of the expression being `null` is the same as the boolean literal.

Using a null-aware operator such as `??` on a variable inside a condition
doesn't promote the variable to a non-nullable type. 
If you want the variable to be promoted inside the body of the `if` statement,
it's better to use an explicit `!= null` check instead of `??`. 

### AVOID `late` variables if you need to check whether they are initialized

Dart offers no way to tell if a `late` variable
has been initialized or assigned to.
If you access it, it either immediately runs the initializer
(if it has one) or throws an exception.
Sometimes you have some state that's lazily initialized
where `late` might be a good fit,
but you also need to be able to *tell* if the initialization has happened yet.

Although you could detect initialization by storing the state in a `late` variable
and having a separate boolean field
that tracks whether the variable has been set,
that's redundant because Dart *internally*
maintains the initialized status of the `late` variable.
Instead, it's usually clearer to make the variable non-`late` and nullable.
Then you can see if the variable has been initialized
by checking for `null`.

Of course, if `null` is a valid initialized value for the variable,
then it probably does make sense to have a separate boolean field.


### CONSIDER assigning a nullable field to a local variable to enable type promotion

Checking that a nullable variable is not equal to `null` promotes the variable
to a non-nullable type. That lets you access members on the variable and pass it
to functions expecting a non-nullable type.

Type promotion is only supported, however, for local variables, parameters, and
private final fields. Values that are open to manipulation
[can't be type promoted][].

Declaring members [private][] and [final][], as we generally recommend, is often
enough to bypass these limitations. But, that's not always an option.
One pattern to work around this is to assign the field's value
to a local variable. Null checks on that variable will promote,
so you can safely treat it as non-nullable.

<?code-excerpt "usage_good.dart (shadow-nullable-field)"?>
```dart tag=good
class UploadException {
  final Response? response;

  UploadException([this.response]);

  @override
  String toString() {
    final response = this.response;
    if (response != null) {
      return 'Could not complete upload to ${response.url} '
          '(error code ${response.errorCode}): ${response.reason}.';
    }

    return 'Could not upload (no response).';
  }
}
```

Assigning to a local variable can be cleaner and safer than using `!` every
time you need to treat the value as non-null:

<?code-excerpt "usage_bad.dart (shadow-nullable-field)" replace="/!\./[!!!]./g"?>
```dart tag=bad
class UploadException {
  final Response? response;

  UploadException([this.response]);

  @override
  String toString() {
    if (response != null) {
      return 'Could not complete upload to ${response[!!!].url} '
          '(error code ${response[!!!].errorCode}): ${response[!!!].reason}.';
    }

    return 'Could not upload (no response).';
  }
}
```

Be careful when using a local variable. If you need to write back to the field,
make sure that you don't write back to the local variable instead. (Making the
local variable [`final`][] can prevent such mistakes.) Also, if the field might
change while the local is still in scope, then the local might have a stale
value. Sometimes it's best to simply [use `!`][] on the field.

## Strings

Here are some best practices to keep in mind when composing strings in Dart.

### DO use adjacent strings to concatenate string literals

{% include 'linter-rule-mention.md', rules:'prefer_adjacent_string_concatenation' %}

If you have two string literals—not values, but the actual quoted literal
form—you do not need to use `+` to concatenate them. Just like in C and
C++, simply placing them next to each other does it. This is a good way to make
a single long string that doesn't fit on one line.

<?code-excerpt "usage_good.dart (adjacent-strings-literals)"?>
```dart tag=good
raiseAlarm('ERROR: Parts of the spaceship are on fire. Other '
    'parts are overrun by martians. Unclear which are which.');
```

<?code-excerpt "usage_bad.dart (adjacent-strings-literals)"?>
```dart tag=bad
raiseAlarm('ERROR: Parts of the spaceship are on fire. Other ' +
    'parts are overrun by martians. Unclear which are which.');
```

### PREFER using interpolation to compose strings and values

{% include 'linter-rule-mention.md', rules:'prefer_interpolation_to_compose_strings' %}

If you're coming from other languages, you're used to using long chains of `+`
to build a string out of literals and other values. That does work in Dart, but
it's almost always cleaner and shorter to use interpolation:

<?code-excerpt "usage_good.dart (string-interpolation)"?>
```dart tag=good
'Hello, $name! You are ${year - birth} years old.';
```

<?code-excerpt "usage_bad.dart (string-interpolation)"?>
```dart tag=bad
'Hello, ' + name + '! You are ' + (year - birth).toString() + ' y...';
```

Note that this guideline applies to combining *multiple* literals and values.
It's fine to use `.toString()` when converting only a single object to a string.

### AVOID using curly braces in interpolation when not needed

{% include 'linter-rule-mention.md', rules:'unnecessary_brace_in_string_interps' %}

If you're interpolating a simple identifier not immediately followed by more
alphanumeric text, the `{}` should be omitted.

<?code-excerpt "usage_good.dart (string-interpolation-avoid-curly)"?>
```dart tag=good
var greeting = 'Hi, $name! I love your ${decade}s costume.';
```

<?code-excerpt "usage_bad.dart (string-interpolation-avoid-curly)"?>
```dart tag=bad
var greeting = 'Hi, ${name}! I love your ${decade}s costume.';
```

## Collections

Out of the box, Dart supports four collection types: lists, maps, queues, and sets.
The following best practices apply to collections.

### DO use collection literals when possible

{% include 'linter-rule-mention.md', rules:'prefer_collection_literals' %}

Dart has three core collection types: List, Map, and Set. The Map and Set
classes have unnamed constructors like most classes do. But because these
collections are used so frequently, Dart has nicer built-in syntax for creating
them:

<?code-excerpt "usage_good.dart (collection-literals)"?>
```dart tag=good
var points = <Point>[];
var addresses = <String, Address>{};
var counts = <int>{};
```

<?code-excerpt "usage_bad.dart (collection-literals)"?>
```dart tag=bad
var addresses = Map<String, Address>();
var counts = Set<int>();
```

Note that this guideline doesn't apply to the *named* constructors for those
classes. `List.from()`, `Map.fromIterable()`, and friends all have their uses.
(The List class also has an unnamed constructor, but it is prohibited in null
safe Dart.)

Collection literals are particularly powerful in Dart
because they give you access to the [spread operator][spread]
for including the contents of other collections,
and [`if` and `for`][control] for performing control flow while
building the contents:

[spread]: /language/collections#spread-operators
[control]: /language/collections#control-flow-operators

<?code-excerpt "usage_good.dart (spread-etc)"?>
```dart tag=good
var arguments = [
  ...options,
  command,
  ...?modeFlags,
  for (var path in filePaths)
    if (path.endsWith('.dart')) path.replaceAll('.dart', '.js')
];
```

<?code-excerpt "usage_bad.dart (spread-etc)"?>
```dart tag=bad
var arguments = <String>[];
arguments.addAll(options);
arguments.add(command);
if (modeFlags != null) arguments.addAll(modeFlags);
arguments.addAll(filePaths
    .where((path) => path.endsWith('.dart'))
    .map((path) => path.replaceAll('.dart', '.js')));
```


### DON'T use `.length` to see if a collection is empty

{% include 'linter-rule-mention.md', rules:'prefer_is_empty, prefer_is_not_empty' %}

The [Iterable][] contract does not require that a collection know its length or
be able to provide it in constant time. Calling `.length` just to see if the
collection contains *anything* can be painfully slow.

[iterable]: {{site.dart-api}}/{{site.sdkInfo.channel}}/dart-core/Iterable-class.html

Instead, there are faster and more readable getters: `.isEmpty` and
`.isNotEmpty`. Use the one that doesn't require you to negate the result.

<?code-excerpt "usage_good.dart (dont-use-length)"?>
```dart tag=good
if (lunchBox.isEmpty) return 'so hungry...';
if (words.isNotEmpty) return words.join(' ');
```

<?code-excerpt "usage_bad.dart (dont-use-length)"?>
```dart tag=bad
if (lunchBox.length == 0) return 'so hungry...';
if (!words.isEmpty) return words.join(' ');
```


### AVOID using `Iterable.forEach()` with a function literal

{% include 'linter-rule-mention.md', rules:'avoid_function_literals_in_foreach_calls' %}

`forEach()` functions are widely used in JavaScript because the built in
`for-in` loop doesn't do what you usually want. In Dart, if you want to iterate
over a sequence, the idiomatic way to do that is using a loop.

<?code-excerpt "usage_good.dart (avoid-for-each)"?>
```dart tag=good
for (final person in people) {
  ...
}
```

<?code-excerpt "usage_bad.dart (avoid-for-each)"?>
```dart tag=bad
people.forEach((person) {
  ...
});
```

Note that this guideline specifically says "function *literal*". If you want to
invoke some *already existing* function on each element, `forEach()` is fine.

<?code-excerpt "usage_good.dart (forEach-over-func)"?>
```dart tag=good
people.forEach(print);
```

Also note that it's always OK to use `Map.forEach()`. Maps aren't iterable, so
this guideline doesn't apply.

### DON'T use `List.from()` unless you intend to change the type of the result

Given an Iterable, there are two obvious ways to produce a new List that
contains the same elements:

<?code-excerpt "../../test/effective_dart_test.dart (list-from-1)"?>
```dart
var copy1 = iterable.toList();
var copy2 = List.from(iterable);
```

The obvious difference is that the first one is shorter. The *important*
difference is that the first one preserves the type argument of the original
object:

<?code-excerpt "../../test/effective_dart_test.dart (list-from-good)"?>
```dart tag=good
// Creates a List<int>:
var iterable = [1, 2, 3];

// Prints "List<int>":
print(iterable.toList().runtimeType);
```

<?code-excerpt "../../test/effective_dart_test.dart (list-from-bad)"?>
```dart tag=bad
// Creates a List<int>:
var iterable = [1, 2, 3];

// Prints "List<dynamic>":
print(List.from(iterable).runtimeType);
```

If you *want* to change the type, then calling `List.from()` is useful:

<?code-excerpt "../../test/effective_dart_test.dart (list-from-3)"?>
```dart tag=good
var numbers = [1, 2.3, 4]; // List<num>.
numbers.removeAt(1); // Now it only contains integers.
var ints = List<int>.from(numbers);
```

But if your goal is just to copy the iterable and preserve its original type, or
you don't care about the type, then use `toList()`.


### DO use `whereType()` to filter a collection by type

{% include 'linter-rule-mention.md', rules:'prefer_iterable_whereType' %}

Let's say you have a list containing a mixture of objects, and you want to get
just the integers out of it. You could use `where()` like this:

<?code-excerpt "usage_bad.dart (where-type)"?>
```dart tag=bad
var objects = [1, 'a', 2, 'b', 3];
var ints = objects.where((e) => e is int);
```

This is verbose, but, worse, it returns an iterable whose type probably isn't
what you want. In the example here, it returns an `Iterable<Object>` even though
you likely want an `Iterable<int>` since that's the type you're filtering it to.

Sometimes you see code that "corrects" the above error by adding `cast()`:

<?code-excerpt "usage_bad.dart (where-type-2)"?>
```dart tag=bad
var objects = [1, 'a', 2, 'b', 3];
var ints = objects.where((e) => e is int).cast<int>();
```

That's verbose and causes two wrappers to be created, with two layers of
indirection and redundant runtime checking. Fortunately, the core library has
the [`whereType()`][where-type] method for this exact use case:

[where-type]: {{site.dart-api}}/{{site.sdkInfo.channel}}/dart-core/Iterable/whereType.html

<?code-excerpt "../../test/effective_dart_test.dart (where-type)"?>
```dart tag=good
var objects = [1, 'a', 2, 'b', 3];
var ints = objects.whereType<int>();
```

Using `whereType()` is concise, produces an [Iterable][] of the desired type,
and has no unnecessary levels of wrapping.


### DON'T use `cast()` when a nearby operation will do

Often when you're dealing with an iterable or stream, you perform several
transformations on it. At the end, you want to produce an object with a certain
type argument. Instead of tacking on a call to `cast()`, see if one of the
existing transformations can change the type.

If you're already calling `toList()`, replace that with a call to
[`List<T>.from()`][list-from] where `T` is the type of resulting list you want.

[list-from]: {{site.dart-api}}/{{site.sdkInfo.channel}}/dart-core/List/List.from.html

<?code-excerpt "usage_good.dart (cast-list)"?>
```dart tag=good
var stuff = <dynamic>[1, 2];
var ints = List<int>.from(stuff);
```

<?code-excerpt "usage_bad.dart (cast-list)"?>
```dart tag=bad
var stuff = <dynamic>[1, 2];
var ints = stuff.toList().cast<int>();
```

If you are calling `map()`, give it an explicit type argument so that it
produces an iterable of the desired type. Type inference often picks the correct
type for you based on the function you pass to `map()`, but sometimes you need
to be explicit.

<?code-excerpt "usage_good.dart (cast-map)" replace="/\(n as int\)/n/g"?>
```dart tag=good
var stuff = <dynamic>[1, 2];
var reciprocals = stuff.map<double>((n) => 1 / n);
```

<?code-excerpt "usage_bad.dart (cast-map)" replace="/\(n as int\)/n/g"?>
```dart tag=bad
var stuff = <dynamic>[1, 2];
var reciprocals = stuff.map((n) => 1 / n).cast<double>();
```


### AVOID using `cast()`

This is the softer generalization of the previous rule. Sometimes there is no
nearby operation you can use to fix the type of some object. Even then, when
possible avoid using `cast()` to "change" a collection's type.

Prefer any of these options instead:

*   **Create it with the right type.** Change the code where the collection is
    first created so that it has the right type.

*   **Cast the elements on access.** If you immediately iterate over the
    collection, cast each element inside the iteration.

*   **Eagerly cast using `List.from()`.** If you'll eventually access most of
    the elements in the collection, and you don't need the object to be backed
    by the original live object, convert it using `List.from()`.

    The `cast()` method returns a lazy collection that checks the element type
    on *every operation*. If you perform only a few operations on only a few
    elements, that laziness can be good. But in many cases, the overhead of lazy
    validation and of wrapping outweighs the benefits.

Here is an example of **creating it with the right type:**

<?code-excerpt "usage_good.dart (cast-at-create)"?>
```dart tag=good
List<int> singletonList(int value) {
  var list = <int>[];
  list.add(value);
  return list;
}
```

<?code-excerpt "usage_bad.dart (cast-at-create)"?>
```dart tag=bad
List<int> singletonList(int value) {
  var list = []; // List<dynamic>.
  list.add(value);
  return list.cast<int>();
}
```

Here is **casting each element on access:**

<?code-excerpt "usage_good.dart (cast-iterate)" replace="/\(n as int\)/[!$&!]/g"?>
```dart tag=good
void printEvens(List<Object> objects) {
  // We happen to know the list only contains ints.
  for (final n in objects) {
    if ([!(n as int)!].isEven) print(n);
  }
}
```

<?code-excerpt "usage_bad.dart (cast-iterate)"?>
```dart tag=bad
void printEvens(List<Object> objects) {
  // We happen to know the list only contains ints.
  for (final n in objects.cast<int>()) {
    if (n.isEven) print(n);
  }
}
```

Here is **casting eagerly using `List.from()`:**

<?code-excerpt "usage_good.dart (cast-from)"?>
```dart tag=good
int median(List<Object> objects) {
  // We happen to know the list only contains ints.
  var ints = List<int>.from(objects);
  ints.sort();
  return ints[ints.length ~/ 2];
}
```

<?code-excerpt "usage_bad.dart (cast-from)"?>
```dart tag=bad
int median(List<Object> objects) {
  // We happen to know the list only contains ints.
  var ints = objects.cast<int>();
  ints.sort();
  return ints[ints.length ~/ 2];
}
```

These alternatives don't always work, of course, and sometimes `cast()` is the
right answer. But consider that method a little risky and undesirable—it
can be slow and may fail at runtime if you aren't careful.


## Functions

In Dart, even functions are objects. Here are some best practices
involving functions.


### DO use a function declaration to bind a function to a name

{% include 'linter-rule-mention.md', rules:'prefer_function_declarations_over_variables' %}

Modern languages have realized how useful local nested functions and closures
are. It's common to have a function defined inside another one. In many cases,
this function is used as a callback immediately and doesn't need a name. A
function expression is great for that.

But, if you do need to give it a name, use a function declaration statement
instead of binding a lambda to a variable.

<?code-excerpt "usage_good.dart (func-decl)"?>
```dart tag=good
void main() {
  void localFunction() {
    ...
  }
}
```

<?code-excerpt "usage_bad.dart (func-decl)"?>
```dart tag=bad
void main() {
  var localFunction = () {
    ...
  };
}
```

### DON'T create a lambda when a tear-off will do

{% include 'linter-rule-mention.md', rules:'unnecessary_lambdas' %}

When you refer to a function, method, or named constructor but omit the
parentheses, Dart creates a _tear-off_—a closure that takes the same
parameters as the function and invokes the underlying function when you call it.
If all you need is a closure that invokes a named function with the same
parameters as the closure accepts, don't manually wrap the call in a lambda.

<?code-excerpt "usage_good.dart (use-tear-off)"?>
```dart tag=good
var charCodes = [68, 97, 114, 116];
var buffer = StringBuffer();

// Function:
charCodes.forEach(print);

// Method:
charCodes.forEach(buffer.write);

// Named constructor:
var strings = charCodes.map(String.fromCharCode);

// Unnamed constructor:
var buffers = charCodes.map(StringBuffer.new);
```

<?code-excerpt "usage_bad.dart (use-tear-off)"?>
```dart tag=bad
var charCodes = [68, 97, 114, 116];
var buffer = StringBuffer();

// Function:
charCodes.forEach((code) {
  print(code);
});

// Method:
charCodes.forEach((code) {
  buffer.write(code);
});

// Named constructor:
var strings = charCodes.map((code) => String.fromCharCode(code));

// Unnamed constructor:
var buffers = charCodes.map((code) => StringBuffer(code));
```


## Variables

The following best practices describe how to best use variables in Dart.

### DO follow a consistent rule for `var` and `final` on local variables

Most local variables shouldn't have type annotations and should be declared
using just `var` or `final`. There are two rules in wide use for when to use one
or the other:

*   Use `final` for local variables that are not reassigned and `var` for those
    that are.

*   Use `var` for all local variables, even ones that aren't reassigned. Never use
    `final` for locals. (Using `final` for fields and top-level variables is
    still encouraged, of course.)

Either rule is acceptable, but pick *one* and apply it consistently throughout
your code. That way when a reader sees `var`, they know whether it means that
the variable is assigned later in the function.


### AVOID storing what you can calculate

When designing a class, you often want to expose multiple views into the same
underlying state. Often you see code that calculates all of those views in the
constructor and then stores them:

<?code-excerpt "usage_bad.dart (calc-vs-store1)"?>
```dart tag=bad
class Circle {
  double radius;
  double area;
  double circumference;

  Circle(double radius)
      : radius = radius,
        area = pi * radius * radius,
        circumference = pi * 2.0 * radius;
}
```

This code has two things wrong with it. First, it's likely wasting memory. The
area and circumference, strictly speaking, are *caches*. They are stored
calculations that we could recalculate from other data we already have. They are
trading increased memory for reduced CPU usage. Do we know we have a performance
problem that merits that trade-off?

Worse, the code is *wrong*. The problem with caches is *invalidation*—how
do you know when the cache is out of date and needs to be recalculated? Here, we
never do, even though `radius` is mutable. You can assign a different value and
the `area` and `circumference` will retain their previous, now incorrect values.

To correctly handle cache invalidation, we would need to do this:

<?code-excerpt "usage_bad.dart (calc-vs-store2)"?>
```dart tag=bad
class Circle {
  double _radius;
  double get radius => _radius;
  set radius(double value) {
    _radius = value;
    _recalculate();
  }

  double _area = 0.0;
  double get area => _area;

  double _circumference = 0.0;
  double get circumference => _circumference;

  Circle(this._radius) {
    _recalculate();
  }

  void _recalculate() {
    _area = pi * _radius * _radius;
    _circumference = pi * 2.0 * _radius;
  }
}
```

That's an awful lot of code to write, maintain, debug, and read. Instead, your
first implementation should be:

<?code-excerpt "usage_good.dart (calc-vs-store)"?>
```dart tag=good
class Circle {
  double radius;

  Circle(this.radius);

  double get area => pi * radius * radius;
  double get circumference => pi * 2.0 * radius;
}
```

This code is shorter, uses less memory, and is less error-prone. It stores the
minimal amount of data needed to represent the circle. There are no fields to
get out of sync because there is only a single source of truth.

In some cases, you may need to cache the result of a slow calculation, but only
do that after you know you have a performance problem, do it carefully, and
leave a comment explaining the optimization.


## Members

In Dart, objects have members which can be functions (methods) or data (instance
variables). The following best practices apply to an object's members.

### DON'T wrap a field in a getter and setter unnecessarily

{% include 'linter-rule-mention.md', rules:'unnecessary_getters_setters' %}

In Java and C#, it's common to hide all fields behind getters and setters (or
properties in C#), even if the implementation just forwards to the field. That
way, if you ever need to do more work in those members, you can without needing
to touch the call sites. This is because calling a getter method is different
than accessing a field in Java, and accessing a property isn't binary-compatible
with accessing a raw field in C#.

Dart doesn't have this limitation. Fields and getters/setters are completely
indistinguishable. You can expose a field in a class and later wrap it in a
getter and setter without having to touch any code that uses that field.

<?code-excerpt "usage_good.dart (dont-wrap-field)"?>
```dart tag=good
class Box {
  Object? contents;
}
```

<?code-excerpt "usage_bad.dart (dont-wrap-field)"?>
```dart tag=bad
class Box {
  Object? _contents;
  Object? get contents => _contents;
  set contents(Object? value) {
    _contents = value;
  }
}
```


### PREFER using a `final` field to make a read-only property

If you have a field that outside code should be able to see but not assign to, a
simple solution that works in many cases is to simply mark it `final`.

<?code-excerpt "usage_good.dart (final)"?>
```dart tag=good
class Box {
  final contents = [];
}
```

<?code-excerpt "usage_bad.dart (final)"?>
```dart tag=bad
class Box {
  Object? _contents;
  Object? get contents => _contents;
}
```

Of course, if you need to internally assign to the field outside of the
constructor, you may need to do the "private field, public getter" pattern, but
don't reach for that until you need to.


### CONSIDER using `=>` for simple members

{% include 'linter-rule-mention.md', rules:'prefer_expression_function_bodies' %}

In addition to using `=>` for function expressions, Dart also lets you define
members with it. That style is a good fit for simple members that just calculate
and return a value.

<?code-excerpt "usage_good.dart (use-arrow)"?>
```dart tag=good
double get area => (right - left) * (bottom - top);

String capitalize(String name) =>
    '${name[0].toUpperCase()}${name.substring(1)}';
```

People *writing* code seem to love `=>`, but it's very easy to abuse it and end
up with code that's hard to *read*. If your declaration is more than a couple of
lines or contains deeply nested expressions—cascades and conditional
operators are common offenders—do yourself and everyone who has to read
your code a favor and use a block body and some statements.

<?code-excerpt "usage_good.dart (arrow-long)"?>
```dart tag=good
Treasure? openChest(Chest chest, Point where) {
  if (_opened.containsKey(chest)) return null;

  var treasure = Treasure(where);
  treasure.addAll(chest.contents);
  _opened[chest] = treasure;
  return treasure;
}
```

<?code-excerpt "usage_bad.dart (arrow-long)"?>
```dart tag=bad
Treasure? openChest(Chest chest, Point where) => _opened.containsKey(chest)
    ? null
    : _opened[chest] = (Treasure(where)..addAll(chest.contents));
```

You can also use `=>` on members that don't return a value. This is idiomatic
when a setter is small and has a corresponding getter that uses `=>`.

<?code-excerpt "usage_good.dart (arrow-setter)"?>
```dart tag=good
num get x => center.x;
set x(num value) => center = Point(value, center.y);
```


### DON'T use `this.` except to redirect to a named constructor or to avoid shadowing {:#dont-use-this-when-not-needed-to-avoid-shadowing}

{% include 'linter-rule-mention.md', rules:'unnecessary_this' %}

JavaScript requires an explicit `this.` to refer to members on the object whose
method is currently being executed, but Dart—like C++, Java, and
C#—doesn't have that limitation.

There are only two times you need to use `this.`. One is when a local variable
with the same name shadows the member you want to access:

<?code-excerpt "usage_bad.dart (this-dot)"?>
```dart tag=bad
class Box {
  Object? value;

  void clear() {
    this.update(null);
  }

  void update(Object? value) {
    this.value = value;
  }
}
```

<?code-excerpt "usage_good.dart (this-dot)"?>
```dart tag=good
class Box {
  Object? value;

  void clear() {
    update(null);
  }

  void update(Object? value) {
    this.value = value;
  }
}
```

The other time to use `this.` is when redirecting to a named constructor:

<?code-excerpt "usage_bad.dart (this-dot-constructor)"?>
```dart tag=bad
class ShadeOfGray {
  final int brightness;

  ShadeOfGray(int val) : brightness = val;

  ShadeOfGray.black() : this(0);

  // This won't parse or compile!
  // ShadeOfGray.alsoBlack() : black();
}
```

<?code-excerpt "usage_good.dart (this-dot-constructor)"?>
```dart tag=good
class ShadeOfGray {
  final int brightness;

  ShadeOfGray(int val) : brightness = val;

  ShadeOfGray.black() : this(0);

  // But now it will!
  ShadeOfGray.alsoBlack() : this.black();
}
```

Note that constructor parameters never shadow fields in constructor initializer
lists:

<?code-excerpt "usage_good.dart (param-dont-shadow-field-ctr-init)"?>
```dart tag=good
class Box extends BaseBox {
  Object? value;

  Box(Object? value)
      : value = value,
        super(value);
}
```

This looks surprising, but works like you want. Fortunately, code like this is
relatively rare thanks to initializing formals and super initializers.


### DO initialize fields at their declaration when possible

If a field doesn't depend on any constructor parameters, it can and should be
initialized at its declaration. It takes less code and avoids duplication when
the class has multiple constructors.

<?code-excerpt "usage_bad.dart (field-init-at-decl)"?>
```dart tag=bad
class ProfileMark {
  final String name;
  final DateTime start;

  ProfileMark(this.name) : start = DateTime.now();
  ProfileMark.unnamed()
      : name = '',
        start = DateTime.now();
}
```

<?code-excerpt "usage_good.dart (field-init-at-decl)"?>
```dart tag=good
class ProfileMark {
  final String name;
  final DateTime start = DateTime.now();

  ProfileMark(this.name);
  ProfileMark.unnamed() : name = '';
}
```

Some fields can't be initialized at their declarations because they need to reference
`this`—to use other fields or call methods, for example. However, if the
field is marked `late`, then the initializer *can* access `this`.

Of course, if a field depends on constructor parameters, or is initialized
differently by different constructors, then this guideline does not apply.


## Constructors

The following best practices apply to declaring constructors for a class.

### DO use initializing formals when possible

{% include 'linter-rule-mention.md', rules:'prefer_initializing_formals' %}

Many fields are initialized directly from a constructor parameter, like:

<?code-excerpt "usage_bad.dart (field-init-as-param)"?>
```dart tag=bad
class Point {
  double x, y;
  Point(double x, double y)
      : x = x,
        y = y;
}
```

We've got to type `x` _four_ times here to define a field. We can do better:

<?code-excerpt "usage_good.dart (field-init-as-param)"?>
```dart tag=good
class Point {
  double x, y;
  Point(this.x, this.y);
}
```

This `this.` syntax before a constructor parameter is called an "initializing
formal". You can't always take advantage of it. Sometimes you want to have a
named parameter whose name doesn't match the name of the field you are
initializing. But when you *can* use initializing formals, you *should*.


### DON'T use `late` when a constructor initializer list will do

Dart requires you to initialize non-nullable fields before they can be read.
Since fields can be read inside the constructor body, 
this means you get an error if you don't initialize a
non-nullable field before the body runs.

You can make this error go away by marking the field `late`. That turns the
compile-time error into a *runtime* error if you access the field before it is
initialized. That's what you need in some cases, but often the right fix is to
initialize the field in the constructor initializer list:

<?code-excerpt "usage_good.dart (late-init-list)"?>
```dart tag=good
class Point {
  double x, y;
  Point.polar(double theta, double radius)
      : x = cos(theta) * radius,
        y = sin(theta) * radius;
}
```

<?code-excerpt "usage_bad.dart (late-init-list)"?>
```dart tag=bad
class Point {
  late double x, y;
  Point.polar(double theta, double radius) {
    x = cos(theta) * radius;
    y = sin(theta) * radius;
  }
}
```


The initializer list gives you access to constructor parameters and lets you
initialize fields before they can be read. So, if it's possible to use an initializer list,
that's better than making the field `late` and losing some static safety and
performance.


### DO use `;` instead of `{}` for empty constructor bodies

{% include 'linter-rule-mention.md', rules:'empty_constructor_bodies' %}

In Dart, a constructor with an empty body can be terminated with just a
semicolon. (In fact, it's required for const constructors.)

<?code-excerpt "usage_good.dart (semicolon-for-empty-body)"?>
```dart tag=good
class Point {
  double x, y;
  Point(this.x, this.y);
}
```

<?code-excerpt "usage_bad.dart (semicolon-for-empty-body)"?>
```dart tag=bad
class Point {
  double x, y;
  Point(this.x, this.y) {}
}
```

### DON'T use `new`

{% include 'linter-rule-mention.md', rules:'unnecessary_new' %}

The `new` keyword is optional when calling a constructor.
Its meaning is not clear because factory constructors mean a
`new` invocation may not actually return a new object.

The language still permits `new`, but consider
it deprecated and avoid using it in your code.

<?code-excerpt "usage_good.dart (no-new)"?>
```dart tag=good
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Row(
    children: [
      RaisedButton(
        child: Text('Increment'),
      ),
      Text('Click!'),
    ],
  );
}
```

<?code-excerpt "usage_bad.dart (no-new)" replace="/new/[!$&!]/g"?>
```dart tag=bad
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return [!new!] Row(
    children: [
      [!new!] RaisedButton(
        child: [!new!] Text('Increment'),
      ),
      [!new!] Text('Click!'),
    ],
  );
}
```


### DON'T use `const` redundantly

{% include 'linter-rule-mention.md', rules:'unnecessary_const' %}

In contexts where an expression *must* be constant, the `const` keyword is
implicit, doesn't need to be written, and shouldn't. Those contexts are any
expression inside:

* A const collection literal.
* A const constructor call
* A metadata annotation.
* The initializer for a const variable declaration.
* A switch case expression—the part right after `case` before the `:`, not
  the body of the case.

(Default values are not included in this list because future versions of Dart
may support non-const default values.)

Basically, any place where it would be an error to write `new` instead of
`const`, Dart allows you to omit the `const`.

<?code-excerpt "usage_good.dart (no-const)"?>
```dart tag=good
const primaryColors = [
  Color('red', [255, 0, 0]),
  Color('green', [0, 255, 0]),
  Color('blue', [0, 0, 255]),
];
```

<?code-excerpt "usage_bad.dart (no-const)" replace="/ (const)/ [!$1!]/g"?>
```dart tag=bad
const primaryColors = [!const!] [
  [!const!] Color('red', [!const!] [255, 0, 0]),
  [!const!] Color('green', [!const!] [0, 255, 0]),
  [!const!] Color('blue', [!const!] [0, 0, 255]),
];
```

## Error handling

Dart uses exceptions when an error occurs in your program. The following
best practices apply to catching and throwing exceptions.

### AVOID catches without `on` clauses

{% include 'linter-rule-mention.md', rules:'avoid_catches_without_on_clauses' %}

A catch clause with no `on` qualifier catches *anything* thrown by the code in
the try block. [Pokémon exception handling][pokemon] is very likely not what you
want. Does your code correctly handle [StackOverflowError][] or
[OutOfMemoryError][]? If you incorrectly pass the wrong argument to a method in
that try block do you want to have your debugger point you to the mistake or
would you rather that helpful [ArgumentError][] get swallowed? Do you want any
`assert()` statements inside that code to effectively vanish since you're
catching the thrown [AssertionError][]s?

The answer is probably "no", in which case you should filter the types you
catch. In most cases, you should have an `on` clause that limits you to the
kinds of runtime failures you are aware of and are correctly handling.

In rare cases, you may wish to catch any runtime error. This is usually in
framework or low-level code that tries to insulate arbitrary application code
from causing problems. Even here, it is usually better to catch [Exception][]
than to catch all types. Exception is the base class for all *runtime* errors
and excludes errors that indicate *programmatic* bugs in the code.


### DON'T discard errors from catches without `on` clauses

If you really do feel you need to catch *everything* that can be thrown from a
region of code, *do something* with what you catch. Log it, display it to the
user or rethrow it, but do not silently discard it.


### DO throw objects that implement `Error` only for programmatic errors

The [Error][] class is the base class for *programmatic* errors. When an object
of that type or one of its subinterfaces like [ArgumentError][] is thrown, it
means there is a *bug* in your code. When your API wants to report to a caller
that it is being used incorrectly throwing an Error sends that signal clearly.

Conversely, if the exception is some kind of runtime failure that doesn't
indicate a bug in the code, then throwing an Error is misleading. Instead, throw
one of the core Exception classes or some other type.


### DON'T explicitly catch `Error` or types that implement it

{% include 'linter-rule-mention.md', rules:'avoid_catching_errors' %}

This follows from the above. Since an Error indicates a bug in your code, it
should unwind the entire callstack, halt the program, and print a stack trace so
you can locate and fix the bug.

Catching errors of these types breaks that process and masks the bug. Instead of
*adding* error-handling code to deal with this exception after the fact, go back
and fix the code that is causing it to be thrown in the first place.


### DO use `rethrow` to rethrow a caught exception

{% include 'linter-rule-mention.md', rules:'use_rethrow_when_possible' %}

If you decide to rethrow an exception, prefer using the `rethrow` statement
instead of throwing the same exception object using `throw`.
`rethrow` preserves the original stack trace of the exception. `throw` on the
other hand resets the stack trace to the last thrown position.

<?code-excerpt "usage_bad.dart (rethrow)"?>
```dart tag=bad
try {
  somethingRisky();
} catch (e) {
  if (!canHandle(e)) throw e;
  handle(e);
}
```

<?code-excerpt "usage_good.dart (rethrow)" replace="/rethrow/[!$&!]/g"?>
```dart tag=good
try {
  somethingRisky();
} catch (e) {
  if (!canHandle(e)) [!rethrow!];
  handle(e);
}
```


## Asynchrony

Dart has several language features to support asynchronous programming.
The following best practices apply to asynchronous coding.

### PREFER async/await over using raw futures

Asynchronous code is notoriously hard to read and debug, even when using a nice
abstraction like futures. The `async`/`await` syntax improves readability and
lets you use all of the Dart control flow structures within your async code.

<?code-excerpt "usage_good.dart (async-await)" replace="/async|await/[!$&!]/g"?>
```dart tag=good
Future<int> countActivePlayers(String teamName) [!async!] {
  try {
    var team = [!await!] downloadTeam(teamName);
    if (team == null) return 0;

    var players = [!await!] team.roster;
    return players.where((player) => player.isActive).length;
  } catch (e) {
    log.error(e);
    return 0;
  }
}
```

<?code-excerpt "usage_bad.dart (async-await)"?>
```dart tag=bad
Future<int> countActivePlayers(String teamName) {
  return downloadTeam(teamName).then((team) {
    if (team == null) return Future.value(0);

    return team.roster.then((players) {
      return players.where((player) => player.isActive).length;
    });
  }).catchError((e) {
    log.error(e);
    return 0;
  });
}
```

### DON'T use `async` when it has no useful effect

It's easy to get in the habit of using `async` on any function that does
anything related to asynchrony. But in some cases, it's extraneous. If you can
omit the `async` without changing the behavior of the function, do so.

<?code-excerpt "usage_good.dart (unnecessary-async)"?>
```dart tag=good
Future<int> fastestBranch(Future<int> left, Future<int> right) {
  return Future.any([left, right]);
}
```

<?code-excerpt "usage_bad.dart (unnecessary-async)"?>
```dart tag=bad
Future<int> fastestBranch(Future<int> left, Future<int> right) async {
  return Future.any([left, right]);
}
```

Cases where `async` *is* useful include:

* You are using `await`. (This is the obvious one.)

* You are returning an error asynchronously. `async` and then `throw` is shorter
  than `return Future.error(...)`.

* You are returning a value and you want it implicitly wrapped in a future.
  `async` is shorter than `Future.value(...)`.

<?code-excerpt "usage_good.dart (async)"?>
```dart tag=good
Future<void> usesAwait(Future<String> later) async {
  print(await later);
}

Future<void> asyncError() async {
  throw 'Error!';
}

Future<String> asyncValue() async => 'value';
```

### CONSIDER using higher-order methods to transform a stream

This parallels the above suggestion on iterables. Streams support many of the
same methods and also handle things like transmitting errors, closing, etc.
correctly.

### AVOID using Completer directly

Many people new to asynchronous programming want to write code that produces a
future. The constructors in Future don't seem to fit their need so they
eventually find the Completer class and use that.

<?code-excerpt "usage_bad.dart (avoid-completer)"?>
```dart tag=bad
Future<bool> fileContainsBear(String path) {
  var completer = Completer<bool>();

  File(path).readAsString().then((contents) {
    completer.complete(contents.contains('bear'));
  });

  return completer.future;
}
```

Completer is needed for two kinds of low-level code: new asynchronous
primitives, and interfacing with asynchronous code that doesn't use futures.
Most other code should use async/await or [`Future.then()`][then], because
they're clearer and make error handling easier.

[then]: {{site.dart-api}}/{{site.sdkInfo.channel}}/dart-async/Future/then.html

<?code-excerpt "usage_good.dart (avoid-completer)"?>
```dart tag=good
Future<bool> fileContainsBear(String path) {
  return File(path).readAsString().then((contents) {
    return contents.contains('bear');
  });
}
```

<?code-excerpt "usage_good.dart (avoid-completer-alt)"?>
```dart tag=good
Future<bool> fileContainsBear(String path) async {
  var contents = await File(path).readAsString();
  return contents.contains('bear');
}
```


### DO test for `Future<T>` when disambiguating a `FutureOr<T>` whose type argument could be `Object`

Before you can do anything useful with a `FutureOr<T>`, you typically need to do
an `is` check to see if you have a `Future<T>` or a bare `T`. If the type
argument is some specific type as in `FutureOr<int>`, it doesn't matter which
test you use, `is int` or `is Future<int>`. Either works because those two types
are disjoint.

However, if the value type is `Object` or a type parameter that could possibly
be instantiated with `Object`, then the two branches overlap. `Future<Object>`
itself implements `Object`, so `is Object` or `is T` where `T` is some type
parameter that could be instantiated with `Object` returns true even when the
object is a future. Instead, explicitly test for the `Future` case:

<?code-excerpt "usage_good.dart (test-future-or)"?>
```dart tag=good
Future<T> logValue<T>(FutureOr<T> value) async {
  if (value is Future<T>) {
    var result = await value;
    print(result);
    return result;
  } else {
    print(value);
    return value;
  }
}
```

<?code-excerpt "usage_bad.dart (test-future-or)"?>
```dart tag=bad
Future<T> logValue<T>(FutureOr<T> value) async {
  if (value is T) {
    print(value);
    return value;
  } else {
    var result = await value;
    print(result);
    return result;
  }
}
```

In the bad example, if you pass it a `Future<Object>`, it incorrectly treats it
like a bare, synchronous value.
