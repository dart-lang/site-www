Dart supports the web as one of its core [platforms](/overview#platform).
Dart-to-JavaScript compilers are available both for development
(with a quick edit-refresh cycle)
and for production
(with a focus on code size and speed).

In addition to compilers,
the Dart web platform provides [core libraries][],
access to the [DOM (Document Object Model)][DOM],
and [interoperability for calling JavaScript][interop] from Dart.

You have the option of using Dart web with a higher-level framework.
Many apps that support web plus mobile or desktop are built
using [Flutter][] and [Flutter web][] support.
You can also use [Jaspr][] to build fast and dynamic HTML-based websites.
Flutter web support, Jaspr
and other web frameworks for Dart are powered by the Dart web platform.
