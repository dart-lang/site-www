title: Dart 2 Migration
description: How Dart 2 is different from Dart 1.x, and how you can convert your code to work with Dart 2.
---

**This page is under construction.**
It aims to help developers migrating from Dart 1.x to Dart 2.


## Differences

### Tools

* Tools related to web development have changed.
  For details, see the
  [Dart 2 page for web developers.][webdev dart2]
  * Pub no longer supports `build` and `serve`.
  * Dartium is no longer supported.
* Pub no longer supports transformers.
  Instead, use the new build system. More information:
  * [Web-specific instructions for building, serving, and testing using build_runner][build_runner web]
  * [Build system documentation](https://github.com/dart-lang/build/tree/master/docs)

### Language and libraries

* [Dart's type system][sound Dart] is now sound.
  * [Fixing common type problems][Fixing Common Type Problems]
  * [Email: Breaking Change: --preview-dart-2 turned on by default][Leaf's email]
* The Dart language and core libraries have changed,
  partly as a result of the type system changes.
  * [Dev channel API reference documentation][apiref]
  * [dart-lang/sdk CHANGELOG][]
