title: Dart 2 migration guide
description: How Dart 2 is different from Dart 1.x, and how you can convert your code to work with Dart 2.
---

Dart 2 has a few key differences from earlier versions of Dart.
This page briefly covers those differences and
gives general advice on migrating your code to Dart 2.

For information on _why_ Dart 2 has changed, see the
[Dart 2 announcement.][Dart 2 announcement]


## Differences

The Dart language, libraries, build system, and web development tools have changed.

### Language and libraries

* [Dart's type system][sound Dart] is now sound.
  * [Fixing common type problems][Fixing Common Type Problems]
  * [Flutter announcement: Breaking Change: `--preview-dart-2` turned on by default][Leaf's email]
* Instance creation keywords are now generally optional,
  as described in [Using constructors][]:
  * `new` is always optional.
  * `const` is optional inside of a constant context.
* Dart no longer has checked mode.
  * [Assert statements][] are still supported, but you enable them differently.
* The Dart language and core libraries have changed,
  partly as a result of the type system changes.
  * [Dev channel API reference documentation][apiref]
  * [dart-lang/sdk CHANGELOG][]

### Tools

* Pub no longer supports transformers.
  Instead, use the [new build system.][build system]
* Tools related to web development have changed.
  * The new build system [replaces `pub build` and `pub serve`.][build_runner web]
  * Dartium is no longer supported. Instead, use [dartdevc][] and Chrome.


## Migrating your code {#migration}

How to migrate your code depends on how old your code is
and what platforms it runs on.
For help with migrating web apps,
see the [web app migration guide.][webdev dart2]
If you're migrating a Flutter app,
consult the [breaking change notification.][Flutter breaking changes]
If you publish packages,
then in addition to making platform-specific changes,
follow the [package migration instructions below](#migrating-packages).


### General process

Here's an overview of the process of migrating to Dart 2,
from either Dart 1.x or an earlier version of Dart 2.

1. **Get an up-to-date version of the Flutter or Dart SDK
   and the plugins for any IDEs you use.**
   * [Flutter SDK upgrade instructions][Flutter SDK upgrade]
   * [Dart SDK instructions][Dart SDK install] (server-side or web)
2. **Upgrade the packages your app depends on.**
   * Flutter: [`flutter pub upgrade`][flutter pub upgrade]
   * Server-side or web: [`pub upgrade`][pub upgrade]
3. **Run the [dart2_fix tool.][dart2_fix]** It helps migrate some
   usages of deprecated Dart 1.x APIs to Dart 2.
4. **Run the analyzer** to find [compile-time errors][]
   and deprecation hints.
   * Flutter: [`flutter analyze`][Flutter analyzer]
     or use the problems view in Android Studio/IntelliJ or VS Code.
   * Server-side or web: [`dartanalyzer`][dartanalyzer]
5. **Fix issues in your code and run the analyzer again**,
   repeating until your code passes static analysis.
6. **Run tests to find [runtime errors][].**
   * Run all [automated tests] for your software.
   * Do manual testing, and look for console errors.
   Consider adding automated tests to catch issues that you find.
7. **Fix issues until your code works.**
8. _Optional:_ **Remove `new` and unnecessary `const`.**
   * You can remove these by hand or use a tool such as `dartfmt --fix`.
   * To find occurrences of `new` and unnecessary `const`, add the rules
     `unnecessary_new` and `unnecessary_const` to the `linter` section of your
     [analysis options file][].


### Migrating packages

As a package owner, you need to do the following:

* Follow the migration tips for the platforms that your package supports
  (see [above](#migration)).
* Make sure your package passes Dart 2 analysis (see **Run the analyzer** above)
* Make sure your package's users know how to report issues.
* Respond quickly to issue reports.
* If code changes aren't backward compatible,
  update the lower SDK constraint.

#### Changes and backward compatibility

If you have to change your package's code,
**try to make it work in 1.x**, as well as Dart 2.
For example, you might be able to add type annotations
or (if an API has been removed) to use an alternative 1.x API.

If a backward-compatible change isn't possible,
**update the lower [SDK constraint.][SDK constraints]**

[Test your changes][testing] to make sure that your package works as expected.

#### Upper constraints on the SDK version {#upper-constraint}

Once your package passes Dart 2 analysis, update the upper constraint
to declare that the package is compatible with Dart 2:

```yaml
environment:
  # Works in Dart 2 only.
  sdk: '>=2.0.0 <3.0.0'
```

If you plan to maintain compatibility with older versions of Dart, adjust the
lower SDK constraint accordingly:

```yaml
environment:
  # Works in Dart 1 (starting with 1.20.1), and works in Dart 2.
  sdk: '>=1.20.1 <3.0.0'
```

If you use [features introduced after 2.0,][CHANGELOG]
be sure to specify the correct lower SDK constraint:

```yaml
environment:
  # Works in 2.1 but not 2.0.
  sdk: '>=2.1.0 <3.0.0'
```

<aside class="alert alert-warning" markdown="1">
  **Packages must have an upper constraint of `<3.0.0`** to work in
  Dart 2 stable and subsequent Dart 2 releases.
  Dart 2 dev builds _before_ the stable release have
  lax upper constraint checking and can use packages that have
  no SDK constraints or an upper constraint of `<2.0.0`.
