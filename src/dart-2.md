title: Dart 2 Migration
description: How Dart 2 is different from Dart 1.x, and how you can convert your code to work with Dart 2.
---

Here's the general process for migrating to Dart 2,
from either Dart 1.x or an earlier version of Dart 2:

1. Get an up-to-date version of the Flutter or Dart SDK.
   * [Flutter SDK instructions][Flutter SDK install]
   * [Dart SDK instructions][Dart SDK install] (VM or web)
2. Upgrade the packages your app depends on.
   * Flutter: [`flutter packages upgrade`][flutter package upgrade]
   * Dart VM or web: [`pub upgrade`][pub upgrade]
3. Run the [dart2_fix tool.][dart2_fix]
4. Run the analyzer to find [compile-time errors][Fixing Common Type Problems].
   * Flutter: [`flutter analyze`][Flutter analyzer]
   * Dart VM or web: [`dartanalyzer`][dartanalyzer] with
     [Dart 2 semantics][enable strong mode]
5. Fix issues in your code and run the analyzer again,
   repeating until your code passes static analysis.
6. Run tests to find runtime errors.
   * Run all [automated tests] for your software.
   * Do manual testing, and look for console errors.
   Consider adding automated tests to catch issues that you find.
7. Fix issues until your code works.

Each time the SDK has a significant release, repeat the process.

The rest of this page gives an overview of differences between Dart 1.x and Dart 2,
with links to where you can find more information.

## Differences

### Language and libraries

* [Dart's type system][sound Dart] is now sound.
  * [Fixing common type problems][Fixing Common Type Problems]
  * [Email: Breaking Change: `--preview-dart-2` turned on by default][Leaf's email]
* Dart no longer has checked mode.
  * [Assert statements][] are still supported, but you enable them differently.
* The Dart language and core libraries have changed,
  partly as a result of the type system changes.
  * [Dev channel API reference documentation][apiref]
  * [dart-lang/sdk CHANGELOG][]

### Tools

* Pub no longer supports transformers.
  Instead, use the [new build system.][build system]
* Tools related to web development have changed.
  * The new build system [replaces `pub build` and `pub serve`.][build_runner web]
  * Dartium is no longer supported. Instead, use [dartdevc][] and Chrome.
