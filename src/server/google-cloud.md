title: Using Google Cloud
short-title: Google Cloud
description: Your Dart app can use many Google Cloud services â€” Firebase, Google Cloud Platform, and more.

Dart servers can use many
[Google Cloud products](https://cloud.google.com/products),
often with the help of pre-packaged [Docker images][]
that the Dart team maintains.
For information about creating HTTP servers with Dart, see the
[Write HTTP servers page](/tutorials/server/httpserver).

For information about other Google APIs (including Firebase)
that you might want to use from Dart code,
see the [Google APIs page](/guides/google-apis).

## Recommended solutions

To run Dart in the Cloud, we recommend using serverless computing solutions.

### Cloud Run

You can use Cloud Run's flexible container support,
combined with Dart's Docker images, to run server-side Dart code.
Creating scalable, high performance APIs and event-driven apps
are good use cases for Cloud Run's serverless platform,
which frees developers from managing infrastructure.

Examples of Dart servers implemented to run on Cloud Run are
[in the dart-lang/samples/repo][server examples].

For more information about using Cloud Run, see the documentation for
[building and deploying a service in other languages][cr].

### Functions Framework for Dart

The Functions Framework is a FaaS (Function as a Service) framework
that makes it easy to write Dart functions
instead of server applications for handling web requests.
Using the framework, you can create functions that handle HTTP requests
and [CloudEvents][] and deploy them to Google Cloud.

The [Dart Functions Framework][] is a community-supported project. 

For more information, see [the README][functions docs].

## Other solutions

Depending on your needs, you may also want to consider running Dart on the
following Google Cloud compute platforms.

### Compute Engine

To run Dart code on Compute Engine,
use Compute Engine's support for running containers,
combined with Dart's Docker images.

For more information, see the Compute Engine documentation for
[using software containers][ce].

### Kubernetes

To run Dart on clusters of Compute Engine instances,
use Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).

For more information, see the [GKE overview][].

### App Engine

[App Engine][] support for Dart is incomplete and requires the
[App Engine flexible environment][], which does not
[autoscale to zero instances][scale to zero], so we recommend **Cloud Run** for new
server-side Dart code.
If you _want_ to use App Engine, consider using the [`appengine` package][].
