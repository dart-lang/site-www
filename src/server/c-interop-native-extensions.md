{{site.alert.note}}
  The extension mechanism that was previously discussed
  on this page—_native extensions_—was removed in Dart 2.15.
  
  If you need to call existing code written in C or C++, see the
  [FFI documentation](/server/c-interop).
  
  A mechanism that's similar to 
  native extensions—the [Dart Embedding API][`include/dart_api.h`]—is
  supported when the Dart VM is
  embedded as a library into another application. 
  For examples of how to use the Dart Embedding API, see
  [these examples maintained by the community][examples].
