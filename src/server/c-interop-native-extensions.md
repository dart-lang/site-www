title: Native extensions for the standalone Dart VM
description: The original way for command-line Dart apps to call C/C++ functions.
---

{{site.alert.note}}
The extension mechanism which was previously discussed on this page --
native extensions -- has been deprecated in Dart 2.14 and will be removed in
Dart 2.15.

If you need to call existing code written in C or C++, see
[C & C++ interop using FFI](/server/c-interop).

This deprecation does not affect use-cases where the Dart VM 
is embedded as a library into another application. 
The Dart Embedding API (as defined in the [`include/dart_api.h`][] header) 
remains supported for such use cases. 
The Dart team currently does not provide any guidelines
on how to embed the Dart VM into your application, 
however there are [examples][] maintained by the community
which demonstrate the necessary glue code.
