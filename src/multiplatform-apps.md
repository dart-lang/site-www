We recommend the [Flutter framework][] for developing multi-platform native apps for mobile (iOS & Android), desktop (Windows, Linux, and macOS), and the web.

Flutter is powered by the [Dart platform](/overview#platform), using the
[Dart VM](/overview#platform) for its instant _hot reload_ developer cycle and
the [Dart AOT](/overview#native-platform) native code &
[Dart JS](/overview#web-platform) web compilersfor creating fast production code
for any platform.
