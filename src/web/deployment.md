Deploying a Dart web app works like deploying any other web app.
This page describes how to compile your app, tips for making it smaller
and faster, and points you to resources for serving the app.

## Building your app {#compiling-to-javascript}

Use the `webdev` tool to build your app. It compiles Dart to JavaScript
and generates all the assets you need for deployment.
When you build using the production mode of the compiler,
you get a JavaScript file that's reasonably small,
thanks to the compiler support for tree shaking.

With a little extra work, you can make your deployable app
[smaller, faster, and more reliable](#make-your-app-smaller-faster-and-more-reliable).

### Compile using webdev

[Use the `webdev build` command][build] to create a deployable version
of your app. This command converts your code to JavaScript and saves
the result as `build/web/main.dart.js`. You can use [any option
available to `dart compile js`](/tools/dart-compile#prod-compile-options)
with `webdev build`.

### Make your app smaller, faster, and more reliable

The following steps are optional. They can help make your app more
reliable and responsive.

* [Use the pwa package to make your app work offline](#use-the-pwa-package-to-make-your-app-work-offline)
* [Use deferred loading to reduce your app's initial size](#use-deferred-loading-to-reduce-your-apps-initial-size)
* [Follow best practices for web apps](#follow-best-practices-for-web-apps)
* [Remove unneeded build files](#remove-unneeded-build-files)


#### Use the pwa package to make your app work offline

The [pwa package]({{site.pub-pkg}}/pwa) simplifies the task of
making your app work with limited or no connectivity.
To learn more about using this package, see
[Making a Dart web app offline-capable: 3 lines of code.](https://medium.com/dartlang/making-a-dart-web-app-offline-capable-3-lines-of-code-e980010a7815)


#### Use deferred loading to reduce your app's initial size

You can use Dart's support for deferred loading to
reduce your app's initial download size.
For details, see the language tour's coverage of
[deferred loading](/guides/language/language-tour#lazily-loading-a-library).


#### Follow best practices for web apps

The usual advice for web apps applies to Dart web apps.
Here are a few resources:

* [Fast load times](https://web.dev/fast/)
* [Web Fundamentals](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/)
  (especially [Optimizing Content Efficiency](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/))
* [Progressive Web Apps](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/)
* [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/)


#### Remove unneeded build files

Web compilers can produce files that are useful during development,
such as Dart-to-JavaScript map files, but unnecessary in production.

To remove these files, you can run a command like the following:

Revise the following once https://github.com/dart-lang/angular/issues/1123 is resolved:
{% endcomment %}

```bash
# From the root directory of your app:
find build -type f -name "*.js.map" -exec rm {} +
```

## Serving your app

You can serve your Dart Web app just like you'd serve any other web app.
This section points to tips for serving Dart Web apps,
as well as Dart-specific resources to help you use GitHub Pages or Firebase
to serve your app.

### GitHub Pages

If your app doesn't use routing or require server-side support,
you can serve the app using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
The [peanut][] package is
an easy way to automatically produce a gh-pages branch for any Dart web app.

The [startup_namer example](https://filiph.github.io/startup_namer/)
is hosted using GitHub Pages.
Its files are in the **gh-pages** branch of the
[filiph/startup_namer repo](https://github.com/filiph/startup_namer)
and were built using [peanut.][peanut]


### Firebase
{% comment %}
TODO: Give an example of how to deploy with Firebase, which originally was shown on https://dart.academy/build-a-real-time-chat-web-app-with-dart-angular-2-and-firebase-3/
{% endcomment %}

To learn more about deploying with Firebase, see the following resources:

* The [Firebase Hosting documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/)
  describes how to deploy web apps with Firebase.
* In the Firebase Hosting documentation,
  [Configure Hosting Behavior](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/full-config)
  covers redirects, rewrites, and more.
