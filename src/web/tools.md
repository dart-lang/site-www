For information about general tools for Dart apps, see
[Dart Tools.](/tools)

[webdev](/tools/webdev)
: A command line interface (CLI) for Dart web app development,
  including building and serving web apps.

[dart2js](/tools/dart2js)
: The original Dart-to-JavaScript compiler, with tree shaking.
  IDEs and the webdev CLI use dart2js when building web apps for deployment.

[dartdevc](/tools/dartdevc)
: The Dart dev compiler, a modular Dart-to-JavaScript compiler.
  IDEs and the webdev CLI use dartdevc when running a development server.

[build_runner](/tools/webdev)
: A build package that's used by the webdev CLI.
  You can use it directly for [testing](/tools/webdev#test)
  or if you need more configurability than webdev provides.
