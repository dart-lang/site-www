The [Dart web platform](/overview#web-platform) supports calling
JavaScript using the `js` package,
also known as _package:js_.

For help using the `js` package, see the following:

* Documentation for the `js` package:
  * [pub.dev site page][js]
  * [API reference][js-api]
* Packages that use the `js` package:
  * [firebase][] is a good example of providing a Dart-like API
    to a JavaScript library.
  * [sass][] is an example of a more unusual use case: providing a
    way for JavaScript code to call Dart code.
