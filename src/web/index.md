Dart supports the web as one of its core [platforms](/overview#platform).
Dart-to-JavaScript compilers are available both for development
(with a quick edit-refresh cycle)
and for production
(with a focus on code size and speed).

In addition to compilers,
the Dart web platform provides [core libraries][],
access to the [DOM (Document Object Model)][DOM],
and [interoperability for calling JavaScript][interop] from Dart.

You have the option of using Dart web with a higher-level web app framework.
Several web apps at Google
(including the [Google Ads front end formerly known as AdWords][AdWords])
are built using [AngularDart.][]
Many apps that support both web and mobile are built
using [Flutter][] and [Flutter web][] support.
AngularDart,
Flutter web support,
and other web app frameworks for Dart are powered by the Dart web platform.
