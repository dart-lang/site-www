The `dart fix` command finds and fixes two types of issues:

* Analysis issues that have associated automated fixes
  (sometimes called _quick-fixes_ or _code actions_)
* Issues that have associated package API migration information

To preview proposed changes, use the `--dry-run` flag:

```terminal
$ dart fix --dry-run
```

To apply the proposed changes, use the `--apply` flag:

```terminal
$ dart fix --apply
```
