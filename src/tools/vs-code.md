With the Dart plugin, you can use [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)][vs-code]
to develop Dart apps.
The Flutter site has details on how to set up and use VS Code for Flutter apps.

Until this page has more information,
see the Flutter documentation for instructions that you can apply to
other kinds of Dart apps:

* [Set up an editor][setup] on the Flutter site has
  instructions for installing the Flutter and Dart plugins into VS Code.
* [Visual Studio Code][vscode-flutter] on the Flutter site has
  details on using VS Code to develop Flutter apps.
