Introduced in Dart 2.10, the `dart` tool (`bin/dart`)
is a technical preview of the new command-line interface to the Dart SDK.
The `dart` tool is available no matter how you get the Dart SDK —
whether you explicitly download the Dart SDK or only download
the [Flutter SDK.]({{site.flutter}})

Here's how you might use the `dart` tool
to create, analyze, test, and run an app:

```terminal
$ dart create -t console-full my_app
$ cd my_app
$ dart analyze
$ dart test
$ dart run bin/my_app.dart
```

You can also run [`pub` commands](/tools/pub/cmd) using the `dart` tool:

```terminal
$ dart pub get
$ dart pub outdated
$ dart pub upgrade
```

{{ site.alert.version-note }}
  Before Dart 2.10, the `dart` command was used only to run the
  [Dart VM][dart-vm].
  You can still use it that way, but
  now the command has more functionality.
  Over time, we expect the `dart` command to replace
  most existing commands in the Dart SDK.

The following table shows which commands you can use with the `dart` tool.

|---------+--------------------------------+-----------------------------------|
| Command | Example of use                 | More information                  |
|---------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| analyze | `dart analyze`     | Analyzes the project's Dart source code.<br>Use instead of [`dartanalyzer`][]. |
| compile | `dart compile exe <DART_FILE>` | Compiles Dart to various formats.<br>Use instead of [`dart2js`][] and [`dart2native`][]. | 
| create  | `dart create <DIRECTORY>`      | Creates a new project.<br>Use instead of [`stagehand`.][] | 
| format  | `dart format <DIRECTORY|DART_FILE>` | Formats Dart source code.<br>Use instead of [`dartfmt`][]. | 
| pub     | `dart pub <PUB_COMMAND>`       | Works with packages.<br>Use instead of [`pub`][]. | 
| run     | `dart run <DART_FILE>`         | Runs a Dart program. <br>Use instead of the pre-existing [Dart VM command][dart-vm]. | 
| test    | `dart test [<DIRECTORY|DART_FILE>]` | Runs tests in this package.<br>Use instead of [`pub run test`][`pub`]. |
| _(none)_| `dart <DART_FILE>`             | Runs a Dart program, just like `dart run`. <br>Identical to the pre-existing [Dart VM command][dart-vm]. |

For additional help on any of the commands, enter `dart help <command>`
or follow the links in the **More information** column.
You can also get details on `pub` commands — for example,
`dart help pub outdated`.

PENDING: Add `fix` & `migrate` to the table once we expect to ship
them on the stable channel.

| migrate | `dart migrate`                 | Supports migration to [null safety][].<br> | 

PENDING: Watch https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/43271 for signs
that `dart analyze` will work on a lone file (like dartanalyzer does).
