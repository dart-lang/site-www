The `dart` tool (`bin/dart`)
is a command-line interface to the [Dart SDK](/tools/sdk).
The tool is available no matter how you get the Dart SDKâ€”whether 
you download the Dart SDK explicitly 
or download only the [Flutter SDK.]({{site.flutter}})

Here's how you might use the `dart` tool
to create, analyze, test, and run an app:

```terminal
$ dart create -t console my_app
$ cd my_app
$ dart analyze
$ dart test
$ dart run bin/my_app.dart
```

You can also run [`pub` commands][pub] using the `dart` tool:

```terminal
$ dart pub get
$ dart pub outdated
$ dart pub upgrade
```

The following table shows which commands you can use with the `dart` tool.
If you're developing for Flutter,
you might use the [`flutter` tool][] instead.
