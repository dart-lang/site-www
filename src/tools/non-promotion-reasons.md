This page will have information to help you understand
why type promotion failures occur,
and give tips on how to fix them.
For example, consider the following code:

```dart
class C {
  int? i;                  // (1)
  f() {
    if (i == null) return;
    i.isEven;              // (2)
  }
}
```

The Dart compiler produces an error message for (2)
that points to (1) and explains that
`i` can't be promoted to a non-nullable type
because it's a field.
The usual fix is to either use `i!`
or create a local variable
of type `int` that holds the value of `i`.
