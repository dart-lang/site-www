If you have a transformer that runs slowly&mdash;perhaps because the algorithm
is complex, has many steps, or the data set is large&mdash;you can improve
your app's startup time during the development cycle by making the
transformer <em>lazy</em>.
Pub runs a lazy transformer only when the generated asset is requested,
either by a user or by another transformer.

You can make either a standard transformer or an aggregate transformer run
lazily. This document describes how to create a lazy transformer using a
normal Pub transformer,
but the steps are similar for creating a lazy aggregate transformer.

Most of the steps for writing a lazy transformer are the same
as for writing a normal transformer. This document
only describes the differences specific to lazy transformers.
If you aren't familiar with how to write a normal Pub tranformer, see
[Writing a Pub Transformer](/tools/pub/transformers).

This page uses the lazy_transformer example which you can find
through [Examples of Transformer Code](/tools/pub/transformers/examples).

Note that this transformer example does not run slowly, but is used
for purposes of illustration. If the transformer were passed an
extremely large data set&mdash;the entire contents of the Library of Congress,
for example&mdash;laziness would greatly improve the app's startup time.

## Implementing a lazy transformer

A lazy transformer implements [LazyTransformer][]
from the [barback][] package.

### Implement `LazyTransformer`

In the Dart file with your transformer subclass,
extend the `Transformer` class from the barback package,
and implement `LazyTransformer`:

{% prettify dart %}
class CodedMessageConverter extends Transformer
                            implements LazyTransformer {
{% endprettify %}

### Implement `declareOutputs`

You must implement the only method in the `LazyTransformer` class,
[declareOutputs][], to declare the outputs generated by the
transformer. This enables Pub to determine what assets exist without
needing to immediately run the transformer.

The `declareOutputs` method is passed a `DeclaringTransform` object,
which gives the transformer access to the primary input's id.
For example:

{% prettify dart %}
void declareOutputs(DeclaringTransform transform) {
  transform.declareOutput(transform.primaryId
                                   .changeExtension('.shhhhh'));
}
{% endprettify %}

[declareOutputs]: https://www.dartdocs.org/documentation/barback/latest/barback/DeclaringTransformer/declareOutputs.html

That's all that you need to do!
