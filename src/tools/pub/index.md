description: Use the pub tool to manage Dart packages.

You can use the [`pub` tool](/tools/pub/cmd) to manage Dart packages.
Pub is one of the tools that you get when you
[install](/tools/sdk#install) the Dart SDK.

{% include flutter-packages.md %}

You can access the `pub` commands either through an IDE,
such as WebStorm, or at the command line.
Use whatever approach is most convenient.

## Managing packages

Dart applications rely on packages. If your Dart app uses one or
more library packages, then your app itself must be an
application package.
