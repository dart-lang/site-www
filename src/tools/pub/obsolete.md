As of Dart 2, pub no longer supports `pub build`, `pub serve`, or transformers.
They're replaced by the **build system**,
which includes the **build_runner** tool.

For information about building and serving apps in Dart 2, see the following:

* [build_runner documentation](/tools/build_runner)
* [Build system documents](https://github.com/dart-lang/build/tree/master/docs),
  including
  [getting started with build_runner](https://github.com/dart-lang/build/blob/master/docs/getting_started.md#getting-started-with-build_runner)

For help in switching from Dart 1.x to Dart 2, see the Dart 2 migration guides:

* [Language and core library migration guide](/dart-2#migration)
* [Web app migration guide](/web/dart-2)
