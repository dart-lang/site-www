The `pub` tool has commands for managing packages
and for deploying packages and command-line apps.
For general information about using the pub package manager, see
[How to use packages](/guides/packages).

## Managing package dependencies

Pub provides a number of commands for managing the
[packages your code depends on](/tools/pub/dependencies).

In this group, the most commonly used commands are `pub get` and
`pub upgrade`, which retrieve or upgrade dependencies used by a package.
Every time you modify a pubspec file, run `pub get`
to make sure the dependencies are up to date. Some IDEs
perform this step automatically on the creation of a project,
or any modification of the pubspec.

[`pub cache`](/tools/pub/cmd/pub-cache)
: Manages pub's local package cache. Use this command to add packages
  to your cache, or to perform a clean reinstall of all packages in
  your cache.

[`pub deps`](/tools/pub/cmd/pub-deps)
: Lists all dependencies used by the current package.

[`pub downgrade`](/tools/pub/cmd/pub-downgrade)
: Retrieves the lowest versions of all the packages that are
  listed as dependencies used by the current package. Used for testing
  the lower range of your package's dependencies.

[`pub get`](/tools/pub/cmd/pub-get)
: Retrieves the packages that are listed as the dependencies for
  the current package.
  If a `pubspec.lock` file already exists, fetches the version
  of each dependency (if possible) as listed in the lock file.
  Creates or updates the lock file, as needed.

[`pub outdated`](/tools/pub/cmd/pub-outdated)
: Looks at every package that the current package depends on,
  determines which package dependencies are out of date,
  and gives you advice on how to update them.
  Use this command when you want to update package dependencies.

[`pub upgrade`](/tools/pub/cmd/pub-upgrade)
: Retrieves the latest version of each package listed
  as dependencies used by the current package. If a `pubspec.lock`
  file exists, ignores the versions listed in the lock file and fetches
  the newest versions that honor the constraints in the pubspec.
  Creates or updates the lock file, as needed.


## Running command-line apps

Two commands let you run Dart scripts from the command line:

* The [`pub run`](/tools/pub/cmd/pub-run) command invokes a Dart script in your
  package, or in one of its dependencies.

* The [`pub global`](/tools/pub/cmd/pub-global) command lets you work with
  globally available packages.

## Deploying packages and apps

With pub you can publish packages and command-line apps.

{% include tools/pub-was-a-builder.md %}

### Packages

To share your Dart packages with the world, you can
use the [`pub publish`](/tools/pub/cmd/pub-lish) command to upload the
package to the [pub.dev site]({{site.pub}}). The
[`pub uploader`](/tools/pub/cmd/pub-uploader) command enables specific
users to modify and upload new versions of your package.

### Command-line apps

For any package that contains scripts (anything under the `bin/`
directory), consider adding the `executables` tag to the pubspec file.
When a script is listed under `executables`, users can run
[`pub global activate`](/tools/pub/cmd/pub-global#activating-a-package)
to make it directly available from the command line.

## Global options

Several command-line options work with all of the pub commands.
These include:

`--help` or `-h`
: Print usage information.

`--version`
: Print version of pub.

`--trace`
: Print debugging information when an error occurs.

`--verbosity=<level>`
: The specified level determines the amount of information that is displayed:

* `all`
: Show all output, including internal tracing messages.

* `io`
: Show I/O operations.

* `normal`
: Show errors, warnings, and user messages.

* `solver`
: Show steps during version resolution.

`-verbose` or `-v`
: Equivalent to `--verbosity=all`.
