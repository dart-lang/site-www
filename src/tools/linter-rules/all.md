The following is an auto-generated list of all linter rules
available in the Dart SDK as of version `{{site.data.pkg-vers.SDK.vers}}`.
Add them to your
[`analysis_options.yaml`](/guides/language/analysis-options) file
and adjust as you see fit.

```yaml
linter:
  rules:
    {% for lint in site.data.linter_rules %}
    {%- if lint.sinceDartSdk != "Unreleased" and lint.state != "removed" -%}
    - {{lint.name}}
    {% endif -%}
