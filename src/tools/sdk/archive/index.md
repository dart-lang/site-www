## Stable channel

Stable channel builds are tested and approved for production use.

{% include_relative _archives_table.html channel="stable" %}

## Dev channel

Dev channel builds can provide early access
to new features but might contain bugs.
We don't recommend dev channel builds for production use.

{% include_relative _archives_table.html channel="dev" %}

## Download URLs

You can find the zip files at predictable URLs using the
following pattern:

{% prettify none %}
https://storage.googleapis.com/dart-archive/channels/<[!stable|dev!]>/release/<[!release!]>/sdk/dartsdk-<[!platform!]>-<[!architecture!]>-release.zip
{% endprettify %}

Examples:

{% prettify none %}
https://storage.googleapis.com/dart-archive/channels/stable/release/2.0.0/sdk/dartsdk-windows-ia32-release.zip
https://storage.googleapis.com/dart-archive/channels/stable/release/1.24.3/sdk/dartsdk-macos-x64-release.zip
https://storage.googleapis.com/dart-archive/channels/dev/release/2.0.0-dev.69.5/sdk/dartsdk-linux-x64-release.zip
