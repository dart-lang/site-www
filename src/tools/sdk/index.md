The Dart SDK has the libraries and command-line tools that you need to develop
Dart web, command-line, and server apps. To get the Dart SDK, see [Get Dart](/get-dart).

If you're developing only mobile apps,
then you don't need the Dart SDK; just [install Flutter.][flutter]

To learn about other tools you can use for Dart development, see
the [Dart tools](/tools) page.
