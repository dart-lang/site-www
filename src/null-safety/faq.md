short-title: FAQ (null safety)
---

This page collects some common questions we've heard about [null safety](/null-safety)
based on the experience of migrating Google internal code.

## What runtime changes should I be aware of for users of migrated code?

Most of the effects of migration do not immediately affect users of migrated
code:

-   Static null safety checks for users first apply when they migrate their
    code.
-   Full null safety checks happen when all the code is migrated and sound mode
    is turned on.

Two exceptions to be aware of are:

-   The `!` operator is a runtime null check in all modes, for all users. So,
    when migrating, ensure that you only add `!` where it's an error for a
    `null` to flow to that location, even if the calling code has not migrated
    yet.
-   Runtime checks associated with the `late` keyword apply in all modes, for
    all users. Only mark a field `late` if you are sure it is always initialized
    before it is used.

## What if a value is only `null` in tests?

If a value is only ever `null` in tests, the code can be improved by marking it
non-nullable and making the tests pass non-null values.

## How does `@required` compare to the new `required` keyword?

The `@required` annotation marks named arguments that must be passed; if not,
the analyzer reports a hint.

With null safety, a named argument with a non-nullable type must either have a
default or be marked with the new `required` keyword. Otherwise, it wouldn't
make sense for it to be non-nullable, because it would default to `null` when
not passed.

When null safe code is called from legacy code the `required` keyword is treated
exactly like the `@required` annotation: failure to supply the argument will
cause an analyzer hint.

When null safe code is called from null safe code, failing to supply a
`required` argument is an error.

What does this mean for migration? Be careful if adding `required` where there
was no `@required` before. Any callers not passing the newly-required argument
will no longer compile. Instead, you could add a default or make the argument
type nullable.

## How should I migrate non-nullable fields that should be `final`, but aren't?

Some computations can be moved to the static initializer. Instead of:

{:.bad}
{% prettify dart tag=pre+code %}
// Initialized without values
ListQueue _context;
Float32List _buffer;
dynamic _readObject;

Vec2D(Map<String, dynamic> object) {
  _buffer = Float32List.fromList([0.0, 0.0]);
  _readObject = object['container'];
  _context = ListQueue<dynamic>();
}
{% endprettify %}

you can do:

{:.good}
{% prettify dart tag=pre+code %}
// Initialized with values
final ListQueue _context = ListQueue<dynamic>();
final Float32List _buffer = Float32List.fromList([0.0, 0.0]);
final dynamic _readObject;

Vec2D(Map<String, dynamic> object) : _readObject = object['container'];
{% endprettify %}

However, if a field is initialized by doing computation in the constructor, then
it can't be `final`. With null safety, you'll find this also makes it harder for
it to be non-nullable; if it's initialized too late, then it's `null` until it's
initialized, and must be nullable. Fortunately, you have options:

-   Turn the constructor into a factory, then make it delegate to an actual
    constructor that initializes all the fields directly. A common name for such
    a private constructor is just an underscore: `_`. Then, the field can be
    `final` and non-nullable. This refactoring can be done *before* the
    migration to null safety.
-   Or, mark the field `late final`. This enforces that it's initialized exactly
    once. It must be initialized before it can be read.

## How should I migrate a `built_value` class?

Getters that were annotated `@nullable` should instead have nullable types; then
remove all `@nullable` annotations. For example:

```dart
@nullable
int get count;
```

becomes

```dart
int? get count; //  Variable initialized with ?
```

Getters that were *not* marked `@nullable` should *not* have nullable types,
even if the migration tool suggests them. Add `!` hints as needed then rerun the
analysis.

## How should I migrate a factory that can return `null`?

_Prefer factories that do not return null._ We have seen code that meant to
throw an exception due to invalid input but instead ended up returning null.

Instead of:

{:.bad}
{% prettify dart tag=pre+code %}
  factory StreamReader(dynamic data) {
    StreamReader reader;
    if (data is ByteData) {
      reader = BlockReader(data);
    } else if (data is Map) {
      reader = JSONBlockReader(data);
    }
    return reader;
  }
{% endprettify %}

Do:

{:.good}
{% prettify dart tag=pre+code %}
  factory StreamReader(dynamic data) {
    if (data is ByteData) {
      // Move the readIndex forward for the binary reader.
      return BlockReader(data);
    } else if (data is Map) {
      return JSONBlockReader(data);
    } else {
      throw ArgumentError('Unexpected type for data');
    }
  }
{% endprettify %}


If the intent of the factory was indeed to return null, then you can turn it
into a static method so it is allowed to return `null`.

## How should I migrate an `assert(x != null)` that now shows as unnecessary?

The assert will be unnecessary when everything is fully migrated, but for now it
*is* needed if you actually want to keep the check. Options:

-   Decide that the assert is not really necessary, and remove it. This is a
    change in behavior when asserts are enabled.
-   Decide that the assert can be checked always, and turn it into
    `ArgumentError.checkNotNull`. This is a change in behavior when asserts are
    not enabled.
-   Keep the behavior exactly as is: add `// ignore:
    unnecessary_null_comparison` to bypass the warning.

## How should I migrate a runtime null check that now shows as unnecessary?

An explicit runtime null check, for example `if (arg == null) throw
ArgumentError(...)`, will be flagged as an unnecessary comparison if you make
`arg` non-nullable.

But, the check *is* still needed if the program is a mixed-version one.  Until
everything is fully migrated and the code switches to running with sound null
safety, it will be possible for `arg` to be null.

The simplest way to preserve behavior is change the check into
[`ArgumentError.checkNotNull`]({{site.dart_api}}/{{site.data.pkg-vers.SDK.channel}}/dart-core/ArgumentError/checkNotNull.html).

The same applies to some runtime type checks. If `arg`
has static type `String`, then `if (arg is! String)` is actually checking
whether `arg` is `null`. It might look like migrating to null safety means `arg`
can never be `null`, but it could be `null` in unsound null safety. So, to preserve
behavior, the null check should remain.

## The `Iterable.firstWhere` method no longer accepts `orElse: () => null`.

Import `package:collection` and use the extension method `firstWhereOrNull`
instead of `firstWhere`.

## How do I deal with attributes that have setters?

Unlike the `late final` suggestion above, these attributes cannot be marked as
final. Often, settable attributes also do not have initial values since they are
expected to be set sometime later.

In such cases, you have two options:

-   Set it to an initial value. Often times, the omission of an initial value is
    by mistake rather than deliberate.
-   If you are _sure_ that the attribute needs to be set before accessed, mark
    it as `late`.

    WARNING: The `late` keyword adds a runtime check. If any user calls `get`
    before `set` they'll get an error at runtime.

## How do I signal that the return value from a Map is non-nullable?

The
[lookup operator]({{site.dart_api}}/{{site.data.pkg-vers.SDK.channel}}/dart-core/Map/operator_get.html)
on Map (`[]`) by default returns a nullable type. There's no way to signal to
the language that the value is guaranteed to be there.

In this case, you should use the bang operator (`!`) to cast the value back to
V:

```dart
return blockTypes[key]!;
```

Which will throw if the map returns null. If you want explicit handling for that case:

```dart
var result = blockTypes[key];
if (result != null) return result;
// Handle the null case here, e.g. throw with explanation.
```

## Why is the generic type on my List/Map nullable?

It is typically a code smell to end up with nullable code like this:

{:.bad}
{% prettify dart tag=pre+code %}
List<Foo?> fooList; // fooList can contain null values
{% endprettify %}

This implies `fooList` might contain null values. This might happen if you are
initializing the list with length and filling it in via a loop.

If you are simply initializing the list with the same value, you should instead
use the 
[`filled`]({{site.dart_api}}/{{site.data.pkg-vers.SDK.channel}}/dart-core/List/List.filled.html) 
constructor.

{:.bad}
{% prettify dart tag=pre+code %}
_jellyCounts = List<int?>(jellyMax + 1);
for (var i = 0; i <= jellyMax; i++) {
  _jellyCounts[i] = 0; // List initialized with the same value
}
{% endprettify %}

{:.good}
{% prettify dart tag=pre+code %}
_jellyCounts = List<int>.filled(jellyMax + 1, 0); // List initialized with filled constructor
{% endprettify %}

If you are setting the elements of the list via an index, or you are populating
each element of the list with a distinct value, you should instead use the
list literal syntax to build the list.

{:.bad}
{% prettify dart tag=pre+code %}
_jellyPoints = List<Vec2D?>(jellyMax + 1);
for (var i = 0; i <= jellyMax; i++) {
  _jellyPoints[i] = Vec2D(); // Each list element is a distinct Vec2D
}
{% endprettify %}

{:.good}
{% prettify dart tag=pre+code %}
_jellyPoints = [
  for (var i = 0; i <= jellyMax; i++)
    Vec2D() // Each list element is a distinct Vec2D
];
{% endprettify %}

## What happened to the default List constructor?

You may encounter this error:

```none
The default 'List' constructor isn't available when null safety is enabled. #default_list_constructor
```

The default list constructor fills the list with `null`, which is a problem.

Change it to `List.filled(length, default)` instead.

## I'm using `package:ffi` and get a failure with `Dart_CObject_kUnsupported` when I migrate. What happened?

Lists sent via ffi can only be `List<dynamic>`, not `List<Object>` or
`List<Object?>`. If you didn't change a list type explicitly in your migration,
a type might still have changed because of changes to type inference that happen
when you enable null safety.

The fix is to explicitly create such lists as `List<dynamic>`.

## Why does the migration tool add comments to my code? {#migration-comments}

The migration tool adds `/* == false */` or `/* == true */` comments when it
sees conditions that will always be false or true while running in sound mode.
Comments like these might indicate that the automatic migration is incorrect and
needs human intervention. For example:

```dart
if (registry.viewFactory(viewDescriptor.id) == null /* == false */)
```

In these cases, the migration tool can't distinguish defensive-coding situations
and situations where a null value is really expected. So the tool tells you what
it knows ("it looks like this condition will always be false!") and lets you
decide what to do.

## What should I know about dart2js and null safety?

For a long time, the dart2js compiler has had optimizations specifically
targeting null values and null checks. Because of that, null safety is not
expected to affect much the output of the compiler.

A few notes that are worth highlighting:

* dart2js emits `!` null assertions, but you may not notice them.
  That's because pre null-safety dart2js already emitted null checks
  (so they are already in the existing programs).

* dart2js emits these null assertions regardless of sound/unsound null safety
  and regardless of optimization level. In fact, dart2js doesn't remove
  `!` when using `-O3` or `--omit-implicit-checks`.

* dart2js may optimize away unnecessary null checks. This is because the same
  optimizations done by dart2js in the past will be able to eliminate
  unnecessary null checks when it knows the value is not null.

* By default dart2js would generate parameter subtype checks (runtime checks
  used to ensure covariant virtual calls are given appropriate arguments).
  These are elided with the `--omit-implicit-checks` flag just as before.
  Recall that this flag can make programs have unexpected behavior if types
  are invalid, so we continue to recommend that the code has strong test
  coverage to avoid any surprises. In particular, dart2js optimizes code based
  on the fact that inputs should comply with the type declaration. If
  the code provides arguments of an invalid type, those optimizations would
  be wrong and the program could misbehave. This was true for inconsistent
  types before, and is true with inconsistent nullabilities now with sound
  null-safety.

* You may notice that DDC and the Dart VM have special error
  messages for null checks, but to keep applications small dart2js does not.

* You may see errors indicating that `.toString` is not found on `null`.
  This is not a bug, it is how dart2js has always encoded some null checks.
  That is, dart2js represents some null checks compactly by making an unguarded
  access of a property of the
  receiver. So instead of `if (a == null) throw`, it generates `a.toString`.
  The `toString` method is defined in JavaScript Object and is a fast
  way to verify that an object is not null.

  If the very first action after a null check is an action that
  will crash when the value is null, dart2js can remove the null check and
  let the action cause the error.

  For example, a Dart expression `print(a!.foo());` could turn directly into:

  ```js
    P.print(a.foo$0());
  ```

  This is because the call `a.foo$()` will crash if `a` is null.
  If dart2js inlines `foo`, it will preserve the null check.
  So for example, if `foo` was `int foo() => 1;`  the compiler might generate:

  ```js
    a.toString;
    P.print(1);
  ```

  If by chance the first thing the inlined method did was a field access on the
  receiver, for example  `int foo() => this.x + 1;`, then again dart2js
  can remove the redundant `a.toString` null check, just like
  non-inlined calls, and generate:

  ```js
    P.print(a.x + 1);
  ```
