<p><em>Current stable version of Dart:
<span class="editor-build-rev-stable">[calculating]</span></em></p>

If you’re a Flutter developer, you get Dart when you
[install Flutter](https://flutter.io/setup/)
or [upgrade Flutter.](https://flutter.io/upgrading/)

Otherwise, install the **Dart SDK** to get everything you need to write and run Dart code:
VM, libraries, analyzer, package manager, doc generator,
formatter, debugger, and more.

If you're doing web development, you might also want **Dartium**.
Instructions for installing Dartium are also provided in the following pages,
or see the [zip file archive](/install/archive).

## Automated installation and updates

A package manager can help you easily install and update the Dart SDK.

* [Installing Dart on Windows](/install/windows) with Chocolatey or a
  Windows installer
* [Installing Dart on Mac](/install/mac) with homebrew
* [Installing Dart on Linux](/install/linux) with our Debian package


## Manual install

Not using a package manager for your OS? No problem!

[Download](/install/archive)
zip files of the Dart SDK, Dartium, and docs.


## Looking for an older version?

Check out our [zip file archive](/install/archive) for
previous versions of the Dart SDK.


## About SDK release channels and version strings

The Dart SDK has two release channels:

* **stable** channel: **stable releases**
  (updated no more frequently than every 6 weeks)
* **dev** channel: **pre-releases**
  (usually updated 1/week)

Most **alpha** releases of Flutter contain a **dev** channel release of Dart.

**Stable** channel releases of the Dart SDK have version strings like `1.24.2` and `2.0.0`.
They consist of dot-separated integers, with no hyphens or letters.

**Dev** channel releases of the Dart SDK (pre-releases)
have additional characters, starting with a hyphen (`-`).
After the stable release of Dart 1.24.0 on June 12,
dev channel SDKs had version strings beginning with
`1.25.0-dev`—for example, `1.25.0-dev.16.4`.

Although we don't plan to release a 1.25 Dart SDK on the stable channel,
the `1.25.0-dev` releases made it possible to use the latest SDK without
worrying about [SDK constraints][] and [semantic versioning.][semantic versioning]
Now that breaking changes are expected,
we’ve switched to version strings beginning with `2.0.0-dev`.

For more information, see
[Dart 2 Updates](/dart-2)
and the [installation instructions](#) for your platform.
