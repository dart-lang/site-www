<p>Current stable version of Dart:
<span class="editor-build-rev-stable">[calculating]</span></p>

Install the Dart SDK to get everything you need to write and run Dart code:
VM, libraries, analyzer, package manager, doc generator,
formatter, debugger, and more.

If you are doing web development, you will also need **Dartium**.
Instructions for installing Dartium are also provided in the following pages,
or see the [zip file archive](/install/archive).
