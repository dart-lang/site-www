Don't want to use Chocolatey or a Windows installer?
Another option is
[installing Dart manually](/install/archive).

* [Using a third-party installer](#installer)
* [Installing using Chocolatey](#chocolatey)

## Using a third-party installer {#installer}

A
[Dart SDK installer for Windows](http://www.gekorm.com/dart-windows/)
is available and supported by the community.
You can use the wizard to install stable or dev versions of
the Dart SDK and Dartium.

## Installing using Chocolatey {#chocolatey}

With [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/),
installing Dart is easy.

The **dart** package contains the [Dart SDK](/tools/sdk),
which includes the Dart VM, libraries, and command-line Dart tools such as
[dart]({{site.dart_vm}}/tools),
[dartanalyzer](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/tree/master/pkg/analyzer_cli),
[pub](/tools/pub),
and [dartdoc](https://github.com/dart-lang/dartdoc#dartdoc).
If you are doing web development, you should also add one more tool:

* [Dartium]({{site.webdev}}/tools/dartium):
  A special build of Chromium that includes a Dart VM.
  Use it to interactively test and debug Dart web apps
  without first compiling them to JavaScript.

If you're working on server-side Dart, all you need is the `dart-sdk`:

{% prettify shell %}
choco install dart-sdk -version <version>
choco install dartium  -version <version>
{% endprettify %}

The current stable version is
<span class="editor-build-rev-stable">[calculating]</span>.

{% comment %}
To choose the dev channel version,
use `-dev<dev-version>`. For example:

{% prettify shell %}
choco install -y dart-sdk -version 1.12.0-dev.2.2
choco install -y dartium  -version 1.12.0-dev.2.2
{% endprettify %}
{% endcomment %}
