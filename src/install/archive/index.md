## Stable channel

Stable channel builds are tested and approved for production use.

{% include_relative _archives_table.html channel="stable" %}

## Dev channel

Dev channel builds may contain bugs and can provide early access
to new features. We do not recommended dev channel builds for
production use.

{% include_relative _archives_table.html channel="dev" %}

## Direct download URLs
