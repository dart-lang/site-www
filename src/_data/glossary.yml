- term: "Bottom type"
  short_description: |-
    A type that has no values and is a subtype of all other types.
  long_description: |-
    The **bottom type** in Dart is the type that has **no values** and is
    considered a [**subtype**](/resources/glossary#subtype) of every other type.

    In Dart, the bottom type is represented by the `Never` type.

    This means a value of type `Never` can be used anywhere,
    because such a value can never actually exist.
    It's most often used as the **return type** of functions to
    indicate they **never return**, such as for those that
    throw exceptions or loop forever.

    For example, the following `fail` function always throws an exception,
    so it's declared with a return type of `Never` to
    indicate that it never returns:

    ```dart
    Never fail(String message) {
      throw Exception(message);
    }

    void main() {
      String result = fail('Oops'); // OK: Never is a subtype of String.
    }
    ```

    Since `fail` never returns, assigning it to a `String` is allowed.

  short_description: |-
    A keyword clause that limits or modifies what's imported or exported.
  long_description: |-
    In Dart, a **combinator** is a clause that
    follows an `import` or `export` directive to limit or modify
    the set of names brought into scope.

    Dart supports two types of combinators:

    - `show` — explicitly includes specific names.
    - `hide` — excludes specific names.

    Combinators help control namespace pollution and
    avoid conflicts when multiple libraries define symbols with the same name.

    Example using `show`:

    ```dart
    import 'dart:math' show pi, sqrt;

    void main() {
      print(pi);      // Accessible
      print(sqrt(9)); // Accessible
      // print(Random()); // Error: Random is not imported.
    }
    ```

    Example using `hide`:

    ```dart
    import 'dart:math' hide pi;

    void main() {
      // print(pi); // Error: pi is hidden.
      print(Random()); // Accessible
    }

  short_description: |-
    The type that the surrounding code expects from an expression.
  long_description: |-
    The **context type** is the type that the surrounding code expects
    from an expression, such as a variable type, a parameter type, or a
    return type.

    Dart uses the context type to interpret and infer meaning
    from expressions, including:

    - **Type inference** ("downwards inference"):

      ```dart
      List<int> list = [];
      ```

      The context type `List<int>` lets the compiler infer the list type as `<int>[]`.

    - **Implicit downcast**:

      ```dart
      String asString(dynamic value) => value;
      ```

      The return context is `String`, so Dart inserts an implicit downcast.

    - **Literal interpretation**:

      ```dart
      double d = 0;
      ```

      The context type `double` makes `0` behave like `0.0`.

    - **Static access shorthand** (dot shorthand):

      ```dart
      int x = .parse(input);
      ```

      The context type is `int`, so `.parse` resolves to `int.parse(input)`.

    Some expressions have no context type, including:

      - **When used as statements**:  
        Expressions like `set.remove(value);` are used only for their
        effect, not their value, so no type is expected.

      - **When the context type is inferred from the expression**:  
        For example, in `var list = [1];`, the list literal has no context type.
        Dart infers `List<int>` from the contents and assigns that type to the variable.

    A _constant context_ is a region of code in which it
    isn't necessary to include the `const` keyword because it's implied by
    the fact that everything in that region is required to be a constant.
    The following locations are constant contexts:

    - Everything inside a list, map or set literal that's prefixed by
      the `const` keyword. For example:

      ```dart
      var l = const [/*constant context*/];
      ```

    - The arguments inside an invocation of a constant constructor.
      For example:

      ```dart
      var p = const Point(/*constant context*/);
      ```

    - The initializer for a variable that's prefixed by the `const` keyword.
      For example:

      ```dart
      const v = /*constant context*/;
      ```

    - Annotations.

- term: "Definite assignment"
  short_description: |-
    The determination of whether a variable has definitely been
    assigned a value before it's used.
  long_description: |-
    Definite assignment analysis is the process of determining, for each
    local variable at each point in the code, which of the following is true:

    - The variable has definitely been assigned a value
      (_definitely assigned_).
    - The variable has definitely not been assigned a value
      (_definitely unassigned_).
    - The variable might or might not have been assigned a value,
      depending on the execution path taken to arrive at that point.

    Definite assignment analysis helps find problems in code,
    such as places where a variable that might not have been
    assigned a value is being referenced, or
    places where a variable that can only be assigned a value one time is
    being assigned after it might already have been assigned a value.

    For example, in the following code the variable `s` is
    definitely unassigned when it's passed as an argument to `print`:

    ```dart
    void f() {
      String s;
      print(s);
    }
    ```

    But in the following code, the variable `s` is definitely assigned:

    ```dart
    void f(String name) {
      String s = 'Hello $name!';
      print(s);
    }
    ```

    Definite assignment analysis can even tell whether
    a variable is definitely assigned (or unassigned) when
    there are multiple possible execution paths.
    In the following code the `print` function is called if
    execution goes through either the true or the false branch of the
    `if` statement, but because `s` is assigned no matter which branch is taken,
    it's definitely assigned before it's passed to `print`:

    ```dart
    void f(String name, bool casual) {
      String s;
      if (casual) {
        s = 'Hi $name!';
      } else {
        s = 'Hello $name!';
      }
      print(s);
    }
    ```

    In flow analysis, the end of the `if` statement is referred to
    as a _join_—a place where two or more execution paths merge back together.
    Where there's a join, the analysis says that
    a variable is definitely assigned if it's definitely assigned along
    all of the paths that are merging, and definitely unassigned if
    it's definitely unassigned along all of the paths.

    Sometimes a variable is assigned a value on one path but not on another,
    in which case the variable might or might not have been assigned a value.
    In the following example, the true branch of the `if` statement might or
    might not be executed, so the variable might or might be assigned a value:

    ```dart
    void f(String name, bool casual) {
      String s;
      if (casual) {
        s = 'Hi $name!';
      }
      print(s);
    }
    ```

    The same is true if there is a false branch that
    doesn't assign a value to `s`.

    The analysis of loops is a little more complicated,
    but it follows the same basic reasoning.
    For example, the condition in a `while` loop is always executed,
    but the body might or might not be. So just like an `if` statement,
    there's a join at the end of the `while` statement between
    the path in which the condition is `true` and
    the path in which the condition is `false`.

  short_description: |-
    An object whose state, including all nested values, can't be changed after it is created.
  long_description: |-
    An immutable object is one whose state can't be modified after it is created.
    When an object is immutable, all of its fields must be `final` (can't be reassigned), and
    the values of those fields must themselves be immutable (can't be mutated).
    This helps ensure consistency and enables safer use in concurrent or reactive code.

    In Dart, a class is immutable if you:

    * Declare all fields as final, so they can't be reassigned.
    * Ensure the field values themselves are immutable.
    * Optionally, use the `@immutable` annotation from the meta package.
      This lets the analyzer warn you if any field is not final or refers to a mutable type.

    Additionally, all Dart const values are immutable. For example, `const [1, 2, 3]`
    creates an immutable list. If a class has a `const` (non-factory) constructor, then
    all of its fields must be final.

    Example:

      ```dart
      import 'package:meta/meta.dart';

      @immutable
      class User {
        final String name;
        final int age;

        const User(this.name, this.age);
      }
      ```

    In the proceeding example, once created, you can't modify the `User` instance.
    You must create a new one to change any data.

    class A {}

    mixin M {}

    sometimes nomenclated as `A+M`. The class `A+M` is a subclass of `A` and
    has members that are copied from `M`.

    You can give an actual name to a mixin application by defining it as:

    ```dart
    class A {}

    mixin M {}

    class A_M = A with M;
    ```

    Given this declaration of `A_M`, the following declaration of `B` is

- term: "Late"
  id: "late"
  short_description: |-
    A keyword that enables deferred initialization of variables and is
    typically used with non-nullable variables.
  long_description: |-
    The `late` keyword in Dart is used to indicate that a variable
    will be initialized later, after its declaration, but before it's used.
    This helps avoid the need to make a variable nullable (`?`) when you
    know it will definitely receive a value, just not immediately.

    Using `late` defers initialization, allowing you to write more
    flexible and readable code, especially when dealing with dependencies
    or complex setup.

    For example:
    ```dart
    late String description;

    void setup() {
      description = 'This will be initialized before use.';
    }
    ```

    Be careful with late variables that are part of a public API.
    If a client accesses the variable before it's initialized,
    they will encounter a `LateInitializationError`, which provides
    little context. In such cases, consider using a
    private nullable variable with a public getter that throws a
    descriptive error (e.g., `StateError`) if accessed too early as
    this can offer clearer feedback to API users, despite the added
    complexity.

    You can also use `late final` when the variable should only be set once.
    This is useful in scenarios where the value is not available at object
    construction time, such as cyclic dependencies in object graphs.

    Example:

    ```dart
    class LinkedQueue<T> {
      late final QueueLink<T> _head;

      LinkedQueue() {
        _head = QueueLink<T>._head(owner: this); // Cyclic reference between objects
      }
    }
    ```

    Be cautious: if a late variable is accessed before it's initialized
    or never initialized at all, it will cause a runtime error.

- term: "Override inference"
  short_description: |-
    How missing types in a method declaration are inferred.
  long_description: |-
    Override inference is the process by which any missing types in
    a method declaration are inferred based on the corresponding types from
    the method or methods that it overrides.

    If a candidate method (the method that's missing type information)
    overrides a single inherited method, then the
    corresponding types from the overridden method are inferred.
    For example, consider the following code:

    ```dart
    class A {
      int m(String s) => 0;
    }

    class B extends A {
      @override
      m(s) => 1;
    }
    ```

    The declaration of `m` in `B` is a candidate because
    it's missing both the return type and the parameter type.
    Because it overrides a single method (the method `m` in `A`),
    the types from the overridden method will be used to infer
    the missing types and it will be as if the method in `B` had been
    declared as `int m(String s) => 1;`.

    If a candidate method overrides multiple methods, and
    the function type one of those overridden methods, M<sub>s</sub>,
    is a supertype of the function types of all of the other overridden methods,
    then M<sub>s</sub> is used to infer the missing types.
    For example, consider the following code:

    ```dart
    class A {
      int m(num n) => 0;
    }

    class B {
      num m(int i) => 0;
    }

    class C implements A, B {
      @override
      m(n) => 1;
    }
    ```

    The declaration of `m` in `C` is a candidate for override inference because
    it's missing both the return type and the parameter type.
    It overrides both `m` in `A` and `m` in `B`, so the compiler needs to
    choose one of them from which the missing types can be inferred.
    But because the function type of `m` in `A` (`int Function(num)`) is
    a supertype of the function type of `m` in `B` (`num Function(int)`),
    the function in `A` is used to infer the missing types. The result is
    the same as declaring the method in `C` as `int m(num n) => 1;`.

    It is an error if none of the overridden methods have a function type that
    is a supertype of all the other overridden methods.

    A type is _potentially non-nullable_ if it's either
    explicitly non-nullable or if it's a type parameter.

    A type is explicitly non-nullable if it is a
    type name that isn't followed by a question mark (`?`).
    Note that there are a few types that are always nullable, such as
    `Null` and `dynamic`, and that `FutureOr` is only non-nullable if
    it isn't followed by a question mark _and_
    the type argument is non-nullable (such as `FutureOr<String>`).

    Type parameters are potentially non-nullable because the actual
    runtime type (the type specified as a type argument) might be non-nullable.
    For example, given a declaration of `class C<T> {}`,
    the type `C` could be used with a non-nullable type argument as in `C<int>`.

    If not, the pattern _refutes_, or denies, the match.
    Refutable patterns appear in [_matching contexts_][].

  short_description: |-
    A class that inherits the implementation of another class.
  long_description: |-
    A _subclass_ is a class that inherits the implementation of another class by
    using the [`extends`][] keyword, or by [mixin application][].

    ```dart
    // A is a subclass of B; B is the superclass of A.
    class A extends B {}

    // B1 has the superclass `A with M`, which has the superclass A.
    class B1 extends A with M {}
    ```

    A subclass relation also implies an associated [subtype](#subtype) relation.
    For example, `class A` implicitly defines an associated type `A`
    which instances of the class `A` inhabit.
    So, `class A extends B` declares not just that the class
    `A` is a subclass of `B`, but also establishes that the *type* `A` is a
    *subtype* of the type `B`.

    Subclass relations are a subset of subtype relations.
    When the documentation says "`S` must be a subtype of `T`",
    it's fine for `S` to be a subclass of `T`.
    However, the converse is not true: not all subtypes are subclasses.

- term: "Shadowing"
  short_description: |-
    When a local declaration hides another with the same name.
  long_description: |-
    **Shadowing** occurs when a local declaration,
    such as a variable or parameter,
    uses the same name as an existing declaration in an outer scope,
    making the outer one inaccessible within the inner scope.

    While valid in Dart, shadowing can lead to
    confusing code or unintended behavior.
    As a result, it's generally discouraged unless
    used deliberately to improve the clarity of your code.

    ### Example

    In this example, the local `message` variable inside
    the `printMessage` function **shadows** the top-level `message` variable:

    ```dart
    final message = 'Global';

    void printMessage() {
      final message = 'Local'; // Shadows the global `message` variable.
      print(message); // Prints: Local
    }

    void main() {
      printMessage();
      print(message); // Prints: Global
    }
    ```

    Shadowing can also occur in nested blocks:

    ```dart
    void main() {
      final value = 10;
      if (true) {
        final value = 20; // Shadows the outer `value` variable.
        print(value);   // Prints: 20
      }
      print(value);     // Prints: 10
    }
    ```

- term: "Subtype"
  short_description: |-
    A type that can be used wherever a value of its supertype is expected.
  long_description: |-
    A _subtype_ relation is where a value of a certain type is substitutable
    where the value of another type, the supertype, is expected.
    For example, if `S` is a subtype of `T`,
    then you can substitute a value of type `S`
    where a value of type `T` is expected.

    A subtype supports all of the operations of its supertype
    (and possibly some extra operations).
    In practice, this means you can assign the value of a subtype
    to any location expecting the supertype,
    and all of the methods of the supertype are available on the subtype.

    This is true at least statically.
    A specific API might not allow the substitution at run time,
    depending on its operations.

    Some subtype relations are based on the structure of the type,
    like with nullable types (for example, `int` is a subtype of `int?`)
    and function types
    (for example, `String Function()` is a subtype of `void Function()`).

    Subtypes can also be introduced for classes by
    [implementation](/language/classes#implicit-interfaces)
    or [inheritance](/language/extend) (direct or indirect):

    ```dart
    // A is a subtype of B, but NOT a subclass of B.
    class A implements B {}

    // C is a subtype AND a subclass of D.
    class C extends D {}
    ```

- term: "Type alias"
  short_description: |-
    A user-defined name for an existing type.
  long_description: |-
    A **type alias** is an alternative name that refers to another type.

    They can be used to simplify complex type definitions,
    improve readability, or create semantic meaning in code.

    Dart supports defining type aliases using the `typedef` keyword.
    You can alias functions, classes, and even generic types.

    ### Examples

    #### Function type alias

    ```dart
    typedef StringTransformer = String Function(String);

    void printTransformed(String input, StringTransformer transformer) {
      print(transformer(input));
    }

    void main() {
      printTransformed('hello', (str) => str.toUpperCase()); // Output: HELLO
    }
    ```

    #### Class alias

    ```dart
    class HttpClient {}

    typedef Client = HttpClient;

    Client client = HttpClient();
    ```

    Type aliases don't create new types, they just provide alternate names.

- term: "Variance and variance positions"
  id: "variance"
  short_description: |-
    How changing a type argument of a type affects the relationship
    between the original type and the resulting one.

    In Dart, changing the type argument of a
    type declaration (like a class) or function return type, changes the
    overall type relationship in the same direction (covariant).

    However, changing the type of a function's parameter types, changes the
    overall type relationship in the opposite direction (contravariant).
  long_description: |-
    A type parameter of a class (or other type declaration, like a mixin) is
    said to be _covariant_ when the type as a whole
    "co-varies" with the actual type argument.
    In other words, if the type argument is replaced by a
    subtype then the type as a whole is also a subtype.

    For example, the type parameter of the class `List` is covariant because
    list types co-vary with their type argument: `List<int>` is a subtype of
    `List<Object>` because `int` is a subtype of `Object`.

    In Dart, all type parameters of all class, mixin,
    mixin class, and enum declarations are covariant.

    However, function types are different:
    A function type is covariant in its return type, but
    the opposite (known as _contravariant_) in its parameter types.
    For example, the type `int Function(int)` is a
    subtype of the type `Object Function(int)`, but it is a
    supertype of `int Function(Object)`.

    This makes sense if you consider their [substitutability](#subtype).
    If you call a function with a static type of `int Function(int)`,
    that function can actually be of type `int Function(Object)` at runtime.
    Based on the static type, you expect to be able to pass an `int` to it.
    That will be fine since the function actually accepts any `Object`,
    and this includes every object of type `int`.
    Similarly, the returned result will be of type `int`,
    which is also what you expect based on the static type.

    Hence, `int Function(Object)` is a subtype of `int Function(int)`.

    Note that everything is turned upside-down for parameter types.
    In particular, this subtype relation among function types requires that
    the _opposite_ subtype relation exists for the parameter type.
    For example, `void Function(Object)` is a subtype of `void Function(int)`
    because `int` is a subtype of `Object`.

    With a more complex type like `List<void Function(int)>`,
    you have to consider the _positions_ in the type.
    To accomplish this, turn one of the parts of the type into a placeholder,
    and then consider what happens to the type when
    different types are placed in that position.

    For example, consider `List<void Function(_)>` as a template for
    a type where you can put different types in place of the placeholder `_`.
    This type is contravariant in the position where that placeholder occurs.

    The following illustrates this by substituting `Object` and `int` for `_`.
    `List<void Function(Object)>` is a subtype of `List<void Function(int)>`
    because `void Function(Object)` is a subtype of `void Function(int)` because
    `void` is a subtype of `void` (the return types) and
    `int` is a subtype of `Object` (the parameter types, in the opposite order).
    Hence, the type at `_` varies in the opposite direction of
    the type `List<void Function(_)>` as a whole, and this
    'opposite direction' by definition makes it a _contravariant position_.

    A _covariant position_ is defined similarly.
    For example, `_` is at a covariant position in the type `List<_>`,
    and `_` is also at a covariant position in the type `_ Function(int)`.

    There is yet another kind of position known as _invariant_,
    but it occurs much more rarely so the details are omitted here.

    In practice, it's often sufficient to know that
    the type arguments of a class, mixin, etc. are in a covariant position,
    and so is the return type of a function type, but
    the parameter types are in a contravariant position.

- term: "Wildcard"
  id: "wildcard"
  short_description: |-
    A symbol (`_`) used instead of a variable name to
    indicate an unused value in patterns and other contexts.
  long_description: |-
    A wildcard is the underscore character (`_`) used to
    ignore values or indicate that a value is intentionally unused.
    It's often used in patterns, destructuring, and switch expressions to
    match any value without binding it to a name.

    Wildcards help make the code more intentional by clearly marking
    values that aren't needed in a specific context.

    Example:

    ```dart
    // Ignoring the value in a for-each loop.
    var names = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'];
    for (var _ in names) {
      print('Someone is here!');
    }
    ```

    The wildcard pattern is particularly useful when:

    - You only need certain parts of a destructured value.
    - You want to explicitly show some values are being ignored.
    - You need a catch-all case in pattern matching.

- term: "Zone"
  id: "zone"
  short_description: |-
    A mechanism to customize the behavior of asynchronous code
    without modifying the asynchronous code itself.
  long_description: |-
    A zone is an execution context that allows you to run code with
    customized behavior for asynchronous events such as timers,
    microtasks, and uncaught errors.

    Zones are useful for:
    - Logging
    - Error tracking
    - Maintaining request-specific state across async gaps
      (for example, in server apps)
    - Testing and debugging async behavior

    Zones provide a way to track and influence asynchronous execution
    without requiring the asynchronous code to be aware of it.

    You can create a new zone using `runZoned` (or `runZonedGuarded`)
    and override zone-specific behavior such as error handling and timers.
    Even `print` can be overridden, although it's not asynchronous and just
    included for convenience.

    Example:
    ```dart
    import 'dart:async';

    void main() {
      runZonedGuarded(() {
        Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 1), () {
          throw 'Zone caught this error!';
        });
      }, (error, stackTrace) {
        print('Caught error: $error');
      });
    }
    ```

    In the preceding example, the uncaught error inside the async callback
    is intercepted by the custom zone.
