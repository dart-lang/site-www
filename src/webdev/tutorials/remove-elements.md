### Dynamically delete items from the browser page.

<div class="panel" markdown="1">

#### <a id="whats-the-point" class="anchor" href="#whats-the-point" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What's the point?

* Use _element_.remove() to remove an element from the DOM.
* Remove all children from an element with _element_.children.clear().
* Function expressions are a convenient way to define single-use functions.
* => is a shorthand syntax for defining functions that contain just one expression.

This tutorial shows you how to delete elements from the DOM.
A new and improved version of the todo app from
[the previous tutorial](add-elements)
now allows the user to delete items from the list
either one at a time, or all at once.

## Try the app

Below is a revised version
of the todo app from the previous tutorial
that allows you to delete items.
Stop procrastinating and remove items from your to do list.

      toDoList.children.clear());

void addToDoItem(Event e) {
  var newToDo = new LIElement();

  toDoInput.value = '';
  toDoList.children.add(newToDo);
}

**Try it!**
Click run ( {% asset red-run.png %} ) to start the web app.
Then type in the app's input field, and press the return key;
a new item appears in the list.
Enter a few more items.
Point the mouse cursor at one of the items in the list;
the item turns red and gets slightly larger.
Click it and it disappears from the list.
Use the **Delete All** button
to remove all of the items in the list at once.

The remaining sections describe
key aspects of the code
added to the todo app for this tutorial.
Specifically, they look at
the Dart code that removes one or more elements from the DOM
and the CSS code that makes the text red and larger.

## Changing the appearance when cursor is over an element

As you saw, an item in the list turns red and gets bigger
when the user points at it.
The mouse cursor also changes shape.
These visual clues are an important part of the user interface
in this example because they are the only indication to the user
that something will happen when the item is clicked.

This behavior is coded in the todo_with_delete app's CSS file with this rule:

{% prettify dart %}
#to-do-list li:hover {
  color: red;
  font-size: 18px;
  cursor:pointer;
}
{% endprettify %}

We've used this CSS trick
instead of providing a familiar user interface,
such as a button with an 'X' on it,
to keep the code simpler.

## Removing an element from the DOM tree

An element is removed from
the DOM when it is removed from its parent's list of children.
The
<a href="{{site.dart_api}}/{{site.data.pkg-vers.SDK.channel}}/dart-core/List-class.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">List</a>
class provides functions for finding an item in the list
and removing it.
But, in this case,
using the element's remove() function
is shorter and more concise than
using functions from the List class.

<img class="scale-img-max" src="/tutorials/images/remove-element.png"
     alt="Use element.remove() to remove an element from the DOM">

In the todo_with_delete app,
the user clicks an item to delete it.
This is achieved with one line of Dart code.
When a new to do item is created,
the code registers a mouse click handler on the new element.
When the user clicks that new element,
its event handler causes the element to remove itself from the DOM
with remove().

<img class="scale-img-max" src="/tutorials/images/remove-element-code.png"
     alt="Registering an event handler to delete an item">

When the element removes itself from the DOM,
the browser re-renders the page,
and the item disappears from the to do list.

## Removing all child elements from an element

When the user clicks the **Delete All** button,
all elements are removed from the list.

<img class="scale-img-max" src="/tutorials/images/remove-all-elements.png"
     alt="Use element.children.clear() to remove all of an element's children">

In this case, using the List class's clear() function
yields the most concise code.
Here's the code from the todo_with_delete app
that implements the **Delete All** button.

<ol>
<li markdown="1">
The HTML code creates a button with the ID delete-all.
(The CSS styles it.)

{% prettify dart %}
<button id="delete-all" type="button" style="float:right"> Delete All </button>
{% endprettify %}

</li>

<li markdown="1">
The Dart code gets the button element from the DOM
using querySelector() and the button's ID, #delete-all.
The code registers a mouse click handler on the button;
the handler removes all of the child elements from the to do list.
Here is all of the Dart code related to the **Delete All** button.

<img class="scale-img-max" src="/tutorials/images/remove-all-code.png"
     alt="Remove all child elements from an Element">

</li>
</ol>

## About function expressions and =>

The todo_with_delete app uses
some interesting Dart syntax
when adding an event listener to the **Delete All** button.
The argument passed into the listen() function
is an example of a _function expression_,
which is a shorthand way of defining functions
and it uses the => syntax to define the function concisely.

<img class="scale-img-max" src="/tutorials/images/event-listener-exp.png"
     alt="A one-line function definition">

It is equivalent to writing this:

{% prettify dart %}
deleteAll.onClick.listen((e) {
  toDoList.children.clear();
});
{% endprettify %}

or even this:

{% prettify dart %}
...
void main() {
  ...
  deleteAll.onClick.listen(deleteAllElements);
}

void deleteAllElements(Event e) {
  toDoList.children.clear();
}
...
{% endprettify %}

Function expressions are often used
when registering event handlers on an element
and can extend over multiple lines.
When registering event handlers,
the function must be an EventListener.
That is,
it returns no value and takes an Event object as a parameter.


## What next?

Rather than implement your web app using low-level APIs, you can leverage
existing toolkits.
We recommend AngularDart, an app framework designed for building
scalable web apps. It's featured in the Dart web development codelabs.
