## Diagrams

This directory contains sources for generating images used across the website.

These come in various forms, such as 
`.graffle` used by the [OmniGraffle][] tool 
as well as PNGs and SVGs generated with [diagrams.net][].

Do **NOT** optimize any images or vectors that are in this directory. 
They contain metadata used by editors to enable editing the image.
